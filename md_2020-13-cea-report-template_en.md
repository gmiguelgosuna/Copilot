> Introduction
>
> A clinical evaluation assessment report (CEAR) is a report used by the
> notified body to clearly document the conclusions of its assessment of
> the clinical evidence presented by the manufacturer in the clinical
> evaluation report (CER) and the related clinical evaluation that was
> conducted -- a core requirement of the Medical Device Regulation (EU)
> 2017/745 (MDR).
>
> The clinical evaluation must be a part of the manufacturer\'s quality
> management. It should also be aligned with and reflected in other
> aspects of the technical documentation, such as:

-   The interface of the clinical evaluation with the risk management
    > process and its appraisal and analysis of the pre-

> clinical and clinical evaluation and their relevance for the
> demonstration of conformity with the relevant requirements in Annex
> I.^1^

-   Post-market surveillance including any corrective and preventive
    > actions involving the device.

-   Post-market clinical follow-up plan and where appropriate the
    > post-market clinical follow-up report.

-   Instructions for use, which provide adequate information on intended
    > purpose, proper use and warnings about

> risks to patients and healthcare practitioners.
>
> As part of its conformity assessment activities the notified body
> shall examine, validate and verify that manufacturers\' procedures and
> documentation adequately address the requirements relating to the
> technical documentation^2^ and clearly document its assessment^3^.
>
> The notified body shall review the clinical evidence presented by the
> manufacturer in the clinical evaluation report and the related
> clinical evaluation that was conducted, which includes^4^:
>
> • Assessing the suitability of using data from claimed equivalent
> devices, taking into account factors such as new indications and
> innovation. The notified body shall clearly document its conclusions
> on the claimed equivalence, and on the relevance and adequacy of the
> data for demonstrating conformity. For any characteristic of the
> device claimed as innovative by the manufacturer or for new
> indications, the notified body shall assess to what extent specific
> claims are supported by specific pre-clinical and clinical data and
> risk analysis.
>
> • Verifying that the clinical evidence and the clinical evaluation are
> adequate and shall verify the conclusions drawn by the manufacturer on
> the conformity with the relevant general safety and performance
> requirements. That verification shall include consideration of the
> adequacy of the benefit-risk determination, the risk management, the
> instructions for use, the user training and the manufacturer\'s
> post-market surveillance plan, and include a review of the need for,
> and the adequacy of, the PMCF plan proposed, where applicable.
>
> • Considering the clinical evaluation and the benefit-risk
> determination, and whether specific milestones need to be defined to
> allow the notified body to review updates to the clinical evidence
> that result from post-market surveillance and PMCF data.
>
> The outcome of this assessment must be clearly documented in the
> CEAR.^5^ A harmonised CEAR template provides a standardised method for
> documenting the notified body's assessment of the manufacturer's
> clinical evaluation and related documents. CEARs in this format will
> also support **specific additional requirements** such as the clinical
> evaluation consultation procedure^6^ and reviews by designating
> authorities.^7^

> Section 10 of Annex XI(A).^8^ Aspects related to the clinical
> evaluation assessment are also laid down in Section 4.5.5 and other
> relevant sections of Annex VII. It also applies to medical devices for
> which clinical data is not deemed appropriate,^9^ to demonstrate
> conformity with Annex I, and the demonstration of an adequate
> justification for this.^10^
>
> Approach to Template
>
> Please note that the explanatory text under each heading provides
> brief descriptions of the type of information which will be included
> by the notified body, however it is not an all-inclusive list and
> further detail may be required depending upon the device or the
> intended purpose for which it will be used. This template represents
> **the minimum** **content** for a CEAR and needs to be incorporated
> into the process and procedures of the notified body.^11^ The CEAR
> shall also make a recommendation to support a final review and a final
> decision to be taken by the notified body.
>
> Any non-compliances identified during the assessment of the aspects
> described in the relevant sections of the template, as well as the
> appropriate follow up actions taken by the manufacturer to close them
> need to be documented. This template may be used by the notified body
> to document the non-compliance/deficiencies and queries raised during
> the assessment and the assessment of responses received. It is
> important to note that the completed CEAR may not necessarily contain
> comprehensive information regarding the non-compliance/deficiencies,
> which were raised by the notified body during the course of the
> assessment. The CEAR shall document the outcome^12^ and the
> conclusions^13^ of the assessment.
>
> Designating authorities shall assess whether the clinical evaluation
> assessment was conducted appropriately, considering the assessment,
> procedures, associated documentation and the conclusions;^14^
> Designating authorities will have access to the complete 'audit trail'
> of the notified body.
>
> Expert panels who are conducting a clinical evaluation consultation
> procedure shall assess the CEAR, however they may not have access to
> the complete conformity assessment for the device and associated
> procedures and documentation. To enable the expert panel work, the
> CEAR shall provide sufficient information with respect to the clinical
> evidence provided by the manufacturer, in particular concerning the
> benefit-risk determination, the consistency of that evidence with the
> intended purpose, including the medical indication or indications and
> the PMCF plan.^15^ Expert panels may also request the notified body to
> present its conclusions regarding the clinical evaluation assessment
> report.^16^
>
> It is only once all the non-compliances have been closed out that the
> relevant tick-box should be completed to signal that the assessment is
> positive. In the rare event that there is one or more open minor
> non-compliances at the conclusion of the assessment stage, this must
> be clearly described in the template, together with appropriate
> follow- up actions to close them, and expected completion timelines to
> be followed by the manufacturer under the supervision of the notified
> body.
>
> The sections covered in Annex I of this template are generally
> applicable depending on the type of assessment. The sections covered
> in Annex II may be applicable, depending upon the device under
> evaluation. **All applicable sections** **should be completed,
> relevant conclusions reached and corresponding boxes ticked for the
> report to be complete**. The CEAR should be signed-off by the relevant
> personnel in accordance with the quality management system of the
> notified body. When making available the CEAR to third parties, the
