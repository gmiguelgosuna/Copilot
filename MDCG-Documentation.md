Introduction A clinical evaluation assessment report (CEAR) is a report
used by the notified body to clearly document the conclusions of its
assessment of the clinical evidence presented by the manufacturer in the
clinical evaluation report (CER) and the related clinical evaluation
that was conducted -- a core requirement of the Medical Device
Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (MDR). The clinical evaluation must be a part
of the manufacturer's quality management. It should also be aligned
with and reflected in other aspects of the technical documentation, such
as: • The interface of the clinical evaluation with the risk management
process and its appraisal and analysis of the preclinical and clinical
evaluation and their relevance for the demonstration of conformity with
the relevant requirements in Annex I.1 • Post-market surveillance
including any corrective and preventive actions involving the device. •
Post-market clinical follow-up plan and where appropriate the
post-market clinical follow-up report. • Instructions for use, which
provide adequate information on intended purpose, proper use and
warnings about risks to patients and healthcare practitioners. As part
of its conformity assessment activities the notified body shall examine,
validate and verify that manufacturers' procedures and documentation
adequately address the requirements relating to the technical
documentation2 and clearly document its assessment3. The notified body
shall review the clinical evidence presented by the manufacturer in the
clinical evaluation report and the related clinical evaluation that was
conducted, which includes4: 


Assessing the suitability of using data from claimed equivalent devices,
taking into account factors such as new indications and innovation. The
notified body shall clearly document its conclusions on the claimed
equivalence, and on the relevance and adequacy of the data for
demonstrating conformity. For any characteristic of the device claimed
as innovative by the manufacturer or for new indications, the notified
body shall assess to what extent specific claims are supported by
specific pre-clinical and clinical data and risk analysis. Verifying
that the clinical evidence and the clinical evaluation are adequate and
shall verify the conclusions drawn by the manufacturer on the conformity
with the relevant general safety and performance requirements. That
verification shall include consideration of the adequacy of the
benefit-risk determination, the risk management, the instructions for
use, the user training and the manufacturer's post-market surveillance
plan, and include a review of the need for, and the adequacy of, the
PMCF plan proposed, where applicable. Considering the clinical
evaluation and the benefit-risk determination, and whether specific
milestones need to be defined to allow the notified body to review
updates to the clinical evidence that result from post-market
surveillance and PMCF data.
The outcome of this assessment must be clearly documented in the CEAR.5
A harmonised CEAR template provides a standardised method for
documenting the notified body's assessment of the manufacturer's
clinical evaluation and related documents. CEARs in this format will
also support specific additional requirements such as the clinical
evaluation consultation procedure6 and reviews by designating
authorities.7 Scope This template applies to MDR Annexes IX section 4
and Annex X section 3. It also applies to assessments of technical
documentations on a sampling basis for class IIa/IIb devices in
accordance with Annex IX sections 2.3 and 3.5 and 1
MDR, Annex VII Section 4.5.1 and 4.5.5 MDR, Annexes II and III 3 MDR
Annex VII Section 4.5.5 and 4.6 4 MDR, Annex IX Sections 4.4 to 4.7 5

Section 10 of Annex XI(A).8 Aspects related to the clinical evaluation
assessment are also laid down in Section 4.5.5 and other relevant
sections of Annex VII. It also applies to medical devices for which
clinical data is not deemed appropriate,9 to demonstrate conformity with
Annex I, and the demonstration of an adequate justification for this.10
Approach to Template Please note that the explanatory text under each
heading provides brief descriptions of the type of information which
will be included by the notified body, however it is not an
all-inclusive list and further detail may be required depending upon the
device or the intended purpose for which it will be used. This template
represents the minimum content for a CEAR and needs to be incorporated
into the process and procedures of the notified body.11 The CEAR shall
also make a recommendation to support a final review and a final
decision to be taken by the notified body. Any non-compliances
identified during the assessment of the aspects described in the
relevant sections of the template, as well as the appropriate follow up
actions taken by the manufacturer to close them need to be documented.
This template may be used by the notified body to document the
non-compliance/deficiencies and queries raised during the assessment and
the assessment of responses received. It is important to note that the
completed CEAR may not necessarily contain comprehensive information
regarding the non-compliance/deficiencies, which were raised by the
notified body during the course of the assessment. The CEAR shall
document the outcome12 and the conclusions13 of the assessment.
Designating authorities shall assess whether the clinical evaluation
assessment was conducted appropriately, considering the assessment,
procedures, associated documentation and the conclusions;14 Designating
authorities will have access to the complete 'audit trail' of the
notified body. Expert panels who are conducting a clinical evaluation
consultation procedure shall assess the CEAR, however they may not have
access to the complete conformity assessment for the device and
associated procedures and documentation. To enable the expert panel
work, the CEAR shall provide sufficient information with respect to the
clinical evidence provided by the manufacturer, in particular concerning
the benefit-risk determination, the consistency of that evidence with
the intended purpose, including the medical indication or indications
and the PMCF plan.15 Expert panels may also request the notified body to
present its conclusions regarding the clinical evaluation assessment
report.16 It is only once all the non-compliances have been closed out
that the relevant tick-box should be completed to signal that the
assessment is positive. In the rare event that there is one or more open
minor non-compliances at the conclusion of the assessment stage, this
must be clearly described in the template, together with appropriate
followup actions to close them, and expected completion timelines to be
followed by the manufacturer under the supervision of the notified body.
The sections covered in Annex I of this template are generally
applicable depending on the type of assessment. The sections covered in
Annex II may be applicable, depending upon the device under evaluation.
All applicable sections should be completed, relevant conclusions
reached and corresponding boxes ticked for the report to be complete.
The CEAR should be signed-off by the relevant personnel in accordance
with the quality management system of the notified body. When making
available the CEAR to third parties, the notified body should treat the
personal data within 8
MDCG 2019-13 Article 61(10) 10 Based on the results of the
manufacturer's risk management and on consideration of the specifics of
the interaction between the device and the human body, the clinical

remaining minor non-compliance together with required follow-up actions
to close them and timelines for their completion to be followed by the
manufacturer. State of the art Benchmark devices, state of the art and
other available treatment options: Describe the alternative available
treatment options identified by the manufacturer which could offer
comparable safety and performance for the same treatment indications /
patient populations, etc. Briefly describe how benchmarks for safety and
performance have been identified by the manufacturer in terms of the
state of the art. Benchmarks will normally be based on aggregate data

state of the art still accurate? Can the device still be considered to
be state of the art? Safety, performance and benefit-risk claims -
requirements in terms of the state of the art: What performance and
safety endpoints has the manufacturer identified? In light of the
outcomes achievable with benchmark products and other treatment options,
are these endpoints appropriate and clinically relevant? Have surrogate
endpoints been adequately justified? Has the manufacturer adequately
described an indicative list and specification of parameters used to
determine, based on the state of the art in medicine, the acceptability
of the benefitrisk ratio for the various indications and for the
intended purpose or purposes of the device? Non-compliances identified

novel features of the device and/or the related clinical procedures and
their purpose. What is the possible clinical or health impact in terms
of benefit/risk? Is novelty adequately addressed? ☐
Section D: Clinical literature review With respect to the search
criteria of the literature review, does it: ☐ Address all device sizes,
variants, model and accessories? ☐ Address the same clinical condition?
Further information regarding literature search methods is available in
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4, section A5. Searches for the device in
question, equivalent devices and other devices (for example to support a
description of the state of the art) should be described separately.
With respect to the selection criteria of the literature review, does it
relate to both below: ☐ The device under evaluation or to a device
demonstrated to be equivalent? ☐ The state of the art or alternative
available treatment option? The clinical evaluation should clearly
describe the selection criteria with respect to the regulatory purpose
to which it will apply. The CER should clearly differentiate between the
two types of data referenced above. If the data does not relate to
either of the above, provide a rationale with respect to its inclusion.
Literature search protocol21 Provide a brief summary of the literature
search strategy applied, commenting on:

The adequacy of search terms: for example, it should be sufficiently
broad to establish benchmarks, determine the general state of the art,
determine potential risk, adverse events, undesirable side-effects, etc.
Note that a search which is restricted to the manufacturer's own product
or the name of their chosen equivalent could miss important information
and therefore is not acceptable.

Databases used (to minimize bias multiple databases should be used).
•
Acceptability of inclusion and exclusion criteria.
•
Both favourable and unfavourable data included.
•
Strategies for avoiding duplication of data (for example, across

A literature search and other retrieval of data should be carried out
based on a search protocol. The search protocol should document the
planning of the search before execution.
•
Once the searches have been executed, the adequacy of the searches
should be verified and a literature search report should be compiled to
present details of the execution, any deviations from the literature
search protocol, and the results of the search.
•
It is important that the literature search is documented to such degree
that the methods can be appraised critically, the results can be
verified, and the search reproduced if necessary.
•
Abstracts lack sufficient detail to allow issues to be evaluated
thoroughly and independently, but may be sufficient to allow a first
evaluation of the relevance of a paper. Copies of the full text papers
and documents should be obtained for the appraisal stage.
•
The literature search protocol(s), the literature search report(s), and
full text copies of relevant documents using URL links, become part of
the clinical evidence and, in turn, the technical documentation for the
medical device. Non-compliances identified and resolved for this section
may be briefly described in this box Literature search protocol and

brief summary of the manufacturer's data appraisal methods (i.e. how
they determine whether the data from a given study or other source of
data is of sufficient quality and relevance to be included in the
clinical evaluation. This includes evaluation of criteria including
study design, sources of bias, peer review, relevance to subject device,
etc. Retrieved studies and data sets should be weighted on the basis of
scientific quality and relevance to the scope and objectives of the
clinical evaluation for the subject devices). Justify the acceptability
of the appraisal in terms of: •
Methodological quality and scientific validity of articles retrieved and
evaluated appropriately.
•

1. Introduction This guidance document is not legally binding. It has
been put together following contribution from national competent
authorities, industry and relevant stakeholders and it should therefore
be recognised as best practice. The Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical
devices 1, hereafter referred to as the MDR (medical device regulation),
provides a possibility to use clinical data related to an equivalent
device in the clinical evaluation required for a device under conformity
assessment2. Whilst carrying out a clinical investigation is the most
direct way to generate clinical data concerning the safety and
performance of medical devices for the purpose of CE marking, clinical
data can also be sourced from3  clinical investigation(s) or other
studies reported in scientific literature, of a device for which
equivalence to the device in question can be demonstrated,  reports
published in peer reviewed scientific literature on other clinical
experience of either the device in question or a device for which
equivalence to the device in question can be demonstrated Equivalence
shall be demonstrated according to the MDR requirements 4. The European
Commission has published a guide on clinical evaluation under the
directives 93/42/EEC and 90/385/EEC; MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev. 4 5. This MEDDEV
guide should be used also during the process of demonstrating
equivalence under the MDR. However, it has been recognised that some of
the requirements set out in MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev. 4 are not fully aligned
with the MDR and that further guidance to address the differences would
be of benefit to industry and other stakeholders. Only the text of the
MDR is legally binding. In cases of divergence between the MEDDEV 2.7/1
rev. 4, this MDCG guidance and the MDR, the MDR shall take precedence.
This MDCG guidance does not introduce any new requirements. The
demonstration of equivalence does not remove the requirement to always
conduct a clinical evaluation in accordance with the MDR. It is the
demonstration of equivalence6 that allows the manufacturer to let
clinical data from an equivalent device enter the clinical evaluation
process of the device in question for the purpose of confirmation of
conformity with relevant general safety and performance

from an equivalent device8 to include in the process of clinical
evaluation. 2. Scope This MDCG guidance covers the demonstration of
equivalence, based on data pertaining to an already existing device on
the market9, for the purpose of CE-marking under the MDR. One of the
purposes of this document is to highlight the differences between the
MDR and the MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev.4 specifically with regards to equivalence.
It is also intended to provide additional guidance and support a
harmonised approach to the demonstration of equivalence across the EU.
In addition, non-exhaustive guidance and references have been provided
with respect to device considerations for medical devices incorporating
an ancillary medicinal product. This MDCG guidance also covers products
without an intended medical purpose listed in Annex XVI of the MDR. 3.
Equivalence The MDR requires10 that technical, biological and clinical
characteristics are considered when demonstrating equivalence to another
device. Whilst these general characteristics are described in the MEDDEV
2.7/1 rev. 4 Appendix 1 and are aligned with the MDR requirement, there
are differences in the criteria that are set out for each of the three
characteristics. Differences in criteria between the MDR and the MEDDEV
2.7/1 rev. 4 are highlighted below and are accompanied by some
explanatory text. 3.1
Technical characteristics
MDR, Annex XIV Part A (3) The device is of similar design; is used under
similar conditions of use; has similar specifications and properties
including physicochemical properties such as intensity of energy,
tensile strength, viscosity, surface characteristics, wavelength and
software algorithms; uses similar deployment methods, where relevant;
has similar principles of operation and critical performance
requirements.
MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev 4, Appendix A1 - be of similar design, and - used under
the same conditions of use, and - have similar specifications and
properties (e.g. physicochemical properties such as type and intensity
of energy, tensile strength, viscosity, surface characteristics,
wavelength, surface texture, porosity, particle size, nanotechnology,
specific mass, atomic inclusions such as nitrocarburising, oxidability),
and - use similar deployment methods (if relevant), and - have similar
principles of operation and critical performance requirements
7
MDR, Article 61 (1) and (3 (a)). MDR, Article 2 (48) 1st and 4th indent.
9 Whether the 'market' is presumed to be the EU market or not is related
to requirements in Article 61. See section 4 (d) and (e) in this
document for further guidance. 10 MDR, Annex XIV Part A (3). 8
Page 5 of 20
(a) The MDR requires that technical characteristics shall be taken into
consideration for the demonstration of equivalence including that the
device in question and the device presumed to be equivalent are "used
under similar conditions of use". MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev. 4, however,
specifies use under the same conditions with regard to technical
characteristics 11. The conditions of use shall be similar to the extent
that there would be no clinically significant difference in the safety
and clinical performance between the device in question and the device
presumed to be equivalent. For further guidance on the assessment of
'similar', see also section 4 of this document. (b) Different examples
are given for specifications and properties of the device when
considering technical characteristics across the two definitions. These
are examples only and are to be considered as such. They must not be
interpreted as an exhaustive list of specifications and properties of
technical characteristics when considering equivalence to another
device. Note however that the MDR specifically points out that software
algorithms shall be similar in the device presumed to be equivalent.
This includes software algorithms in software driving or influencing the
use of a device, and in software intended to be used alone 12. It is the
functional principle of the software algorithm, as well as the clinical
performance(s) and intended purpose(s) of the software algorithm, that
shall be considered when demonstrating the equivalence of a software
algorithm. It is not reasonable to demand that equivalence is
demonstrated for the software code, provided it has been developed in
line with international standards for safe design and validation13 of
medical device software. Software solely intended for the configuration
of a device (e.g. presentation on a graphical user interface etc), and
not related to any medical purpose14 (e.g. diagnosis, treatment etc),
does not need to be similar when considering equivalence as long as it
can be justified to not negatively affect the usability, safety or
clinical performance. 3.2
Biological characteristics
MDR, Annex XIV Part A (3) The device uses the same materials or
substances in contact with the same human tissues or body fluids for a
similar kind and duration of contact and similar release characteristics
of substances, including degradation products and leachables
MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev. 4, Appendix A1 Use the same materials or substances in
contact with the same human tissues or body fluids. Exceptions can be
foreseen for devices in contact with intact skin and minor components of
devices; in these cases risk analysis results may allow the use of
similar materials taking into account the role and nature of the similar
material.
11
"Conditions of use" with regard to technical characteristics may e.g. be
environmental factors such as magnetic fields, temperature, moisture,
conditions during transport of device in use etc. See section 3.3 in
this document regarding use for the same clinical condition or purpose.
12 See MDCG 2019-11 Guidance on Qualification and Classification of
Software in Regulation (EU) 2017/745 MDR and Regulation (EU) 2017/746 --
IVDR. 13 E.g. IEC 62304 Medical device software -- Software life cycle
processes, and IEC 82304-1 Health software -- Part 1: General
requirements for product safety. 14 MDR, Article 2(1).

(a) Manufacturers must consider the additional text in the MDR and
adequately specify all applicable characteristics. The exceptions,
outlined in the MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev 4, to not use the same materials are
NOT acceptable under the MDR. The MDR requires that biological
characteristics shall be taken into consideration for the demonstration
of equivalence, i.e. the device uses the same materials or substances in
contact with the same human tissues or body fluids for a similar kind
and duration of contact, and with similar release characteristics of
substances, including degradation products and leachables, as the
presumed equivalent device. The distinction between "same materials or
substances" and "similar release characteristics of substances" is made
to account for the fact that processing, design and the use environment
may introduce small changes even when the raw materials are the same.
Processing can make materials more susceptible to degradation by
changing properties of the material and/or by inducing different
stresses. For example, small changes in pH or oxidative stress can
increase or decrease release characteristics. For this reason, it is the
final device that shall be assessed. (b) The principles outlined in ISO
10993 series of standards for the biological evaluation of medical
devices can be adopted, in particular the ISO 10993-1 for a risk-based
approach to biological evaluation15 and also for material
characterization. In addition, the ISO 10993-18 which covers chemical
characterization of materials can be adopted to specify the identity of
materials and to estimate the type and quantity of leachables from the
final device. Annex C of this standard addresses biological equivalence.
The ISO 10993-17 includes principles on the toxicological risk
assessment of leachables. Leachables may include degradation products or
other substances from the materials or substances that the device is
made of, but also other constituents for example residuals from the
manufacturing process or sterilisation, any contaminations etc.
Therefore, for the consideration of equivalence, it is the properties
and characteristics of the final device that shall be taken into
account. For degradable materials, ISO 10993, Parts 13, 14 and 15
address the identification and quantification of degradation products.
Note, that there may be further parts in the ISO 10993 series of
standards that are relevant for the device in question. (c) The MDR has
additional requirements16 for devices that are composed of substances or
of combinations of substances that are intended to be introduced into
the human body, and that are absorbed by or locally dispersed 15
ISO 10993-1 Biological evaluation of medical devices -- Part 1:
Evaluation and testing within a risk management process, and collateral
standards in the 10993 series. 16 MDR, Annex I, (12.2).

in the human body. For the consideration of equivalence, the substances
shall be the same. Those devices are not medicinal products, but for the
conformity assessment they shall comply with the relevant requirements
laid down in Annex I to Directive 2001/83/EC17 for the evaluation of
absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, local tolerance,
toxicity, interaction with other devices, medicinal products or other
substances and potential for adverse reactions. This means that for the
demonstration of equivalence under the MDR, those aspects shall also be
taken into consideration. Note that the requirement 18 that the notified
body shall seek a scientific opinion from a competent authority for
medicinal products or the EMA, for the device or its products of
metabolism, that are systemically absorbed by the human body in order to
achieve their intended purpose, on the compliance with the relevant
requirements laid down in Annex I to Directive 2001/83/EC, always
applies for the device under evaluation even if equivalence has been
demonstrated under the MDR. (d) The demonstration of equivalence may
also concern medical devices with an ancillary medicinal substance, for
example drug-eluting stents or heparinbonded central venous catheters.
The MDR requires19 that biological characteristics shall be taken into
consideration for the demonstration of equivalence, including that the
device in question and the device presumed to be equivalent, use "the
same materials or substances in contact with the same human tissues or
body fluids". This applies also to the medicinal substance and any
related excipients/coatings. Excipients/coatings may potentially have a
significant effect for example on the release characteristics of the
medicinal substance intended only for a local effect from a stent, and
thereby a significant effect on the clinical performance. In all cases,
concerning the device under evaluation, the notified body shall20 
verify the usefulness of the substance as part of the device, taking
account of the intended purpose of the device, and  seek a scientific
opinion from a competent authority for medicinal products or the EMA to
ensure that the quality, safety and benefit/risk of using the ancillary
medicinal product, including whether the manufacturing process have been
adequately assessed.

Note that medical devices with an ancillary medicinal substance are
class III devices21. In cases where a manufacturer intends to claim
equivalence to a device not manufactured by him, the MDR requires that
the two manufacturers have a contract in place that explicitly allows
the manufacturer of the second device full access to the technical
documentation on an ongoing basis22 . Manufacturers cannot claim
equivalence of a device with an ancillary medicinal substance to a
device without an ancillary medicinal substance and vice versa. For
example, the manufacturer of a heparin coated catheter shall not claim
equivalence to a drug-free catheter even if both catheters are otherwise
identical23 . See also section 4 of this document. Similarly,
manufacturers shall not claim equivalence of the ancillary medicinal
substance to a 'standalone' medicinal substance. 3.3
Clinical characteristics MDR, Annex XIV Part A (3)
MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev. 4, Appendix A1
The device is used for the same clinical condition or purpose, including
similar severity and stage of disease, at the same site in the body, in
a similar population, including as regards age, anatomy and physiology;
has the same kind of user; has similar relevant critical performance in
view of the expected clinical effect for a specific intended purpose.
- used for the same clinical condition (including when applicable
similar severity and stage of disease, same medical indication), and -
used for the same intended purpose, and - used at the same site in the
body, and - used in a similar population (this may relate to age,
gender, anatomy, physiology, possibly other aspects), and - not foreseen
to deliver significantly different performances (in the relevant
critical performances such as the expected clinical effect, the specific
intended purpose, the duration of use, etc.)
(a) The MDR additionally requires that, for manufacturers to compare
clinical characteristics, the device shall have the same kind of user.
The MDR clearly points out that a user means any healthcare professional
or lay person who uses a device24, and that a lay person means an
individual who does not have formal education in a relevant field of
healthcare or medical discipline25. Manufacturers must therefore take
into consideration whether the intended user's competence or knowledge
can have any implication for the safety, clinical performance and
outcome when considering equivalence between the device in question and
the presumed equivalent device. For example, a device intended for
professional use and a device intended for home use, but for the same
clinical condition or purpose, may have a different safety and
performance profile due to the environment in which they are intended to
be used. 21

(3). 24 MDR, Article 2 (37). 25 MDR, Article 2 (38). 22
Page 9 of 20
(b) The MDR does not explicitly state that the medical device needs to
be used for the same medical indication, gender and duration of use as
the equivalent device. However, it is understood that in general, this
is covered by the MDR requirement that both devices should be used for
the same clinical condition or purpose including similar severity and
stage of disease and also have similar relevant critical performance
which is also outlined in the MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev. 4. This is supported by
the definitions in the MDR of the 'intended purpose' 26, and the ability
of the device to achieve its intended purpose by the 'clinical
performance'27 including measurable 'clinical benefit'28. 4.
Demonstration of equivalence MDR, Annex XIV Part A (3) The
characteristics listed in the first paragraph shall be similar to the
extent that there would be no clinically significant difference in the
safety and clinical performance of the device. Considerations of
equivalence shall be based on proper scientific justification.
MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev. 4, Appendix A1 For assuming equivalence, - all three
characteristics (clinical, technical, biological) need to be
fulfilled; - similar means that no clinically significant difference in
the performance and safety of the device would be triggered by the
differences between the device under evaluation and the device presumed
to be equivalent.
There are a number of prerequisites that shall be fulfilled for the
demonstration of equivalence: (a) The overall considerations of
equivalence shall conclude whether the listed technical, biological and
clinical characteristics in the MDR29 are similar to the extent that
there would be no clinically significant difference in the safety and
clinical performance of the device. Note that some of the listed
characteristics in the MDR shall be the same, not only similar. The
corresponding wording from MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev. 4 is presented for
information above. Consideration must be given to the characteristics
mentioned above and a gap analysis should be conducted by the
manufacturer to evaluate any clinically significant difference(s).
Modifications30 of a device may be implemented for a variety of reasons.
If the differences have been introduced to address specific safety
and/or performance issues it shall be duly justified, that there would
be no clinically significant difference in the safety and clinical
performance other than the intended improvements related to the specific
issue that triggered the modification / difference. For all
modifications and concomitant claims of equivalence, there must be no
additional risks or potential of negatively altered performance related
to the introduced modifications. 26

See a template example of an Equivalence table in the Annex I of this
document. A manufacturer of a medical device shall not claim equivalence
to a product without an intended medical purpose listed in the MDR Annex
XVI. (b) Manufacturers may identify more than one equivalent device to
the device under evaluation, but each device shall be equivalent to the
device under evaluation in all the listed technical, biological and
clinical characteristics 31. Equivalence to each device shall be fully
investigated, described and demonstrated in the clinical evaluation
report. This means that manufacturers shall not use different parts of
different devices to claim equivalence to the device under evaluation.
The MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev. 4 is in line with this approach. In exceptional
cases, a deviation from this principle may be considered. There may be
device systems comprised of several more or less "stand alone" devices,
where it may be justified to consider equivalence of a device in the
system to a presumed equivalent device in a device system already on the
market (by the same manufacturer) provided that all technical,
biological and clinical characteristics are same/similar32, and that the
devices in the system do not affect the safety and performance of each
other. This should be duly investigated and documented both on the level
of potential interference between the devices in the system, as well as
on the overall safety and clinical performance of the device system. (c)
Regarding the clinical evaluation, the MDR requires 33 that the
manufacturer shall specify and justify the level of clinical evidence
necessary to demonstrate conformity with the relevant general safety and
performance requirements. That level of clinical evidence shall be
appropriate in view of the characteristics of the device and its
intended purpose34. In addition, considerations of equivalence shall be
based on proper scientific justification 35. This implies that
technical, biological and clinical characteristics shall be duly
investigated and documented. The manufacturer is expected to fully
identify and disclose any differences between the two devices.
Pre-clinical data for the consideration of equivalence should allow a
scientifically sound evaluation of technical and biological
characteristics. Examples of data sources: 31
MDR, Annex XIV Part A (3), the requirement refers to only "a device" and
"the device". MDR, Annex XIV Part A (3). 33 MDR, Article 61 (1) second
paragraph. 34 MDR, Article 61 (1) second paragraph It may under certain
circumstances be justified to demonstrate conformity without support of
clinical data, see MDR, Article 61 (10), but note that this is not
applicable for implantable devices or class III devices. 35 MDR, Annex
XIV Part A (3) For guidance see also MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev 4, Annex A6,

 data from the technical documentation of a manufacturer's own presumed
equivalent device (specifications, test-results,
chemical/physical/biological analyses, data from pre-clinical
investigations etc)  data published in the scientific literature, e.g.
animal or other pre-clinical data The assessment of whether any
differences in characteristics would result in clinically significant
difference in safety and clinical performance shall also be duly
substantiated and based on proper scientific justification. This
assessment may be supported by e.g. clinical data from the scientific
literature, common specifications (CS)36, harmonised standards or other
established technical specifications. Furthermore, for the assessment of
safety, a risk-based approach37 is expected, both for the identification
of characteristics that may affect safety as well as for the final
assessment of equivalence regarding safety. It is important for the
consideration of equivalence that pre-clinical data and any clinical
data relate to the actual device under evaluation, and to a defined
generation/version of the actual device considered for equivalence,
bearing in mind that there may be significant differences between
different generations of the other device. If a manufacturer is not able
to demonstrate sufficient levels of access to the data38 relating to the
presumed equivalent device and needed for the consideration of
equivalence, equivalence claims cannot be made for the purpose of
conformity assessment. (d) The MDR notes specific requirements in
addition to the demonstration of equivalence in order not to perform a
clinical investigation which must be taken into account. A manufacturer
of implantable devices and class III devices shall perform clinical
investigations except if the device has been designed by modifications
of a device already marketed by the same manufacturer and equivalence
can be demonstrated according to the MDR39. In this context, a marketed
device is considered to be a device already placed on the market and CE
marked with respect to either the MDR or the directives 93/42/EEC or
90/385/EEC. The CE marking should still be valid, should be based on an
updated clinical evaluation, and the benefit/risk ratio for this device
should be favourable.

For a manufacturer of implantable devices and class III devices claiming
equivalence to an already marketed device not manufactured by him, in
addition to the requirements in MDR Article 61(4), the manufacturer must
have a contract in place that allows full access to the technical
documentation on an ongoing basis40. Furthermore, the MDR also requires
that the original clinical evaluation of the equivalent device has been
performed in compliance with the requirements of the MDR. This implies
that the presumed equivalent device is certified under the MDR. As such,
it will not be possible to claim equivalence to a device certified with
respect to the Directives 93/42/EEC or 90/385/EEC. (e) For devices other
than implantable devices and class III devices and where the
manufacturer wants to claim equivalence, MDR Article 61 (3) is
applicable. This requirement does not specify whether the device is
presumed to be marketed within the EU. Therefore, it will be possible to
claim equivalence to a device certified with respect to the Directives
93/42/EEC or 90/385/EEC or the MDR. However, exceptions can be
considered, and equivalence claimed to a device that is not CE-marked,
provided all relevant MDR requirements regarding equivalence and
clinical evaluation can be met. This includes  that the manufacturer
shall have sufficient levels of access to the data relating to devices
with which they are claiming equivalence41 . In the circumstance that
the presumed equivalent device is from another manufacturer, there is no
MDR requirement of a contract between the manufacturers for regulating
the access to the technical documentation.  that clinical
investigations were conducted in accordance with international
guidelines42  that the clinical data meet the requirements of the MDR,
and a justification is provided whether the clinical data are
transferrable to the European population. The regulatory status of the
presumed equivalent device should be disclosed. See MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev. 4
Appendix A1 for further guidance. (f) In case of products without an
intended medical purpose listed in MDR Annex XVI clinical investigations
shall be performed for those products unless reliance on existing
clinical data from an analogous medical device is duly justified43. An
analogous device, in this context, is understood as a medical device
which is similar in terms of functioning and risks profile and has a
medical purpose44. To duly justify reliance on existing clinical data
from an analogous 40

Page 13 of 20
medical device, the principles of demonstration of equivalence45 should
be applied with the acceptance that the device under evaluation will
only have an aesthetic or another non-medical purpose whereas the
analogous device has a medical purpose. The general requirement to
demonstrate a clinical benefit46 shall be understood as a requirement to
demonstrate the performance of the device. In addition, since the common
specifications (CS) for the products without an intended medical purpose
may have requirements related to the clinical evaluation regarding
safety47 these requirements must be taken into consideration when
demonstrating equivalence and concluding whether there would be no
clinically significant difference in the safety48. There shall be no
significant difference in the safety and performance between the product
and the presumed analogous medical device. 5. Use of data from similar
devices The term 'similar devices' may be understood as devices
belonging to the same generic device group. The MDR defines this49 as a
set of devices having the same or similar intended purposes or a
commonality of technology allowing them to be classified in a generic
manner not reflecting specific characteristics. In cases where
equivalence cannot be demonstrated under the MDR, the data from similar
devices may be useful for a variety of other purposes, for example: 1.
Ensuring that the risk management system is comprehensive by identifying
relevant hazards and clinical risks. 2. Understanding the state of the
art, the natural course of disease and alternative available treatment
options. 3. Helping to define the scope of the clinical evaluation, by
identifying any design features in similar devices that pose special
performance or safety concerns. 4. Provide input for clinical
investigation design or post-market clinical follow-up design, and the
post-market surveillance system. 5. Identification of relevant and
specified clinical outcome parameters for the intended clinical
benefits, based on the published clinical data pertaining to the similar
device(s). 6. To define minimum requirements for a quantified clinical
benefit that is considered clinically relevant, and/or to identify
acceptable occurrence rates of risks and adverse events.

6. Clinical data identification A clinical evaluation of the device
under assessment shall be made according to the MDR50. All the clinical
data, both favourable and unfavourable shall be identified. This applies
to clinical data from both the device in question and the device for
which equivalence can be demonstrated. If the data meet the definition
of clinical data as defined in the MDR51, the data shall then progress
to data appraisal and analysis in order to evaluate whether the clinical
data are providing sufficient clinical evidence for the purpose of
confirmation of conformity with the relevant general safety and
performance requirements (GSPR)52. For identifying, appraising and
analysing available clinical data from the scientific literature to
establish clinical evidence53, manufacturers will find facilitative
guidance in sections 8-10 of MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev. 4. In the event that the
data do not meet the MDR definition of clinical data these are not
clinical data and cannot be subject to data appraisal, analysis and
evaluation for the purpose of providing clinical evidence for the
confirmation of conformity with the relevant GSPR.

Annex I -- Equivalence table A table, such as the table below, may be
used to clearly demonstrate equivalence and to identify the supporting
data on a device by device basis. The items in the first column of the
table are examples only and are to be considered as such. They must not
be interpreted as an exhaustive list of specifications, properties,
parameters and/or aspects for demonstrating equivalence to another
device. The manufacturer should identify differences and place emphasis
on the differences between the two devices rather than the similarities.
Considerations shall include the potential additive effect of multiple
small differences. For further considerations of equivalence, see
sections 3 and 4 in this document. Scientific justifications shall be
provided for the different characteristics when claiming no clinically
significant difference in the safety and clinical performance of the
device. Where more than one device is assessed for equivalence, the
table should be completed separately for each presumed equivalent
device. The documentation of the demonstration of equivalence shall be
included in the clinical evaluation report.

2. Introduction For ease of reference, the text of Article 61
paragraphs (4)-(6) is included below: Article 61 Clinical evaluation 4.
In the case of implantable devices and class III devices, clinical
investigations shall be performed, except if: --- the device has been
designed by modifications of a device already marketed by the same
manufacturer, --- the modified device has been demonstrated by the
manufacturer to be equivalent to the marketed device, in accordance with
Section 3 of Annex XIV and this demonstration has been endorsed by the
notified body, and --- the clinical evaluation of the marketed device is
sufficient to demonstrate conformity of the modified device with the
relevant safety and performance requirements. In this case, the notified
body shall check that the PMCF plan is appropriate and includes post
market studies to demonstrate the safety and performance of the device.
In addition, clinical investigations need not be performed in the cases
referred to in paragraph 6.
5.
A manufacturer of a device demonstrated to be equivalent to an already
marketed device not manufactured by him, may also rely on paragraph 4 in
order not to perform a clinical investigation provided that the
following conditions are fulfilled in addition to what is required in
that paragraph: --- the two manufacturers have a contract in place that
explicitly allows the manufacturer of the second device full access to
the technical documentation on an ongoing basis, and --- the original
clinical evaluation has been performed in compliance with the
requirements of this Regulation, and the manufacturer of the second
device provides clear evidence thereof to the notified body.
6.
The requirement to perform clinical investigations pursuant to paragraph
4 shall not apply to implantable devices and class III devices: (a)
which have been lawfully placed on the market or put into service in
accordance with Directive 90/385/EEC or Directive 93/42/EEC and for
which the clinical evaluation: --- is based on sufficient clinical data,
and 3(12)
Medical Device Medical Device Coordination Group Document
(b)
MDCG 2023-7
--- is in compliance with the relevant product-specific CS for the
clinical evaluation of that kind of device, where such a CS is
available; or that are sutures, staples, dental fillings, dental braces,
tooth crowns, screws, wedges, plates, wires, pins, clips or connectors
for which the clinical evaluation is based on sufficient clinical data
and is in compliance with the relevant productspecific CS, where such a
CS is available.
Article 61(4) of Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices (MDR)
requires clinical investigations to be performed for implantable and
class III devices, except in four specific cases as outlined in: CASE 1)
indents 1-3 of Article 61(4); CASE 2) Article 61(6)(a); CASE 3) Article
61(6)(b); CASE 4) Article 61(5). These four cases which are exempted
from the requirement to perform clinical investigations are independent
of each other; i.e. the criteria outlined in one paragraph do not apply
to the other paragraphs unless directly referenced. One important
consequence of this independence of cases is that the requirement for a
contract, pursuant to Article 61(5), does not apply to the cases
outlined in indents 13 of Article 61(4), Article 61(6)(a) and Article
61(6)(b). For these cases, it is only necessary to demonstrate
equivalence in accordance with the criteria listed in Annex XIV Section
3 MDR to be able to use the associated clinical data in the clinical
evaluation. In addition to outlining the technical, biological and
clinical characteristics to be taken into consideration for the
demonstration of equivalence, Annex XIV Section 3 mandates that "It
shall be clearly demonstrated that manufacturers have sufficient levels
of access to the data relating to devices with which they are claiming
equivalence in order to justify their claims of equivalence". The
requirement to have sufficient levels of access to the data required to
establish equivalence does not in itself require a contract between the
two manufacturers (see Section 5 of this guidance for further detail).
3. Scope This guidance is intended to clarify the exemptions from the
requirement to perform clinical investigations, and associated
conditions related to the demonstration of equivalence, for implantable
and class III medical devices to be placed on the European market. It
also provides examples and considerations relevant to the demonstration
of "sufficient levels of access to the data" per Annex XIV Section 3. 4.
When are clinical investigations not mandatory according to Article
61(4)-(6) of the MDR? Article 61(4) states that clinical investigations
shall be performed for implantable and class III devices. Indents 1-3 of
Article 61(4) outline the first case which can be 4(12)
Medical Device Medical Device Coordination Group Document
MDCG 2023-7
exempted from this requirement. Articles 61(5) and 61(6) outline
additional exemption cases, as illustrated in Appendix I. Appendix I
shows the parallel nature, and thus independence, of these cases. The
conditions that apply to each case are summarised in Table 1 in this
section. N.B.: Devices which are neither class III nor implantable are
outside the scope of this document. The need for a clinical
investigation(s) for such devices is determined by the objectives of the
clinical evaluation and the sufficiency of existing clinical evidence to
meet those objectives. Please refer to MDCG 2020-5 and MDCG 2020-6 for
further guidance. The beginning of the first sentence of Article 61(4)
provides the general obligation, namely "in the case of implantable
devices and class III devices, clinical investigations shall be
performed". The remainder of Article 61(4), as well as Article 61(5) and
61(6) describe circumstances under which these devices are exempted from
the requirement to conduct clinical investigations; they do not describe
conditions for demonstrating equivalence, nor do they describe when data
from EDs may be used in a clinical evaluation. As summarised in the
Introduction to this guidance, the cases in which implantable and class
III devices are exempted from mandatory clinical investigations are
independent of each other, except where a dependence is explicitly
indicated1, 2. In other words, the criteria outlined in one paragraph do
not apply to the other paragraphs unless directly referenced.
Specifically, the requirement for a contract as described in Article
61(5) does not apply to the exemption cases outlined in Articles 61(4)
and 61(6). A manufacturer may use clinical data generated from another
manufacturer's ED in the clinical evaluation of the DUE, without a
contract, in any of the cases 1 to 33. The only requirement in this
respect is that the equivalence criteria described in Annex XIV Section
3 are met. Use of ED data may enable a manufacturer to demonstrate that
their clinical evaluation is based on "sufficient clinical data".
However the manufacturer is only exempted from the requirement to
perform clinical investigations if the conditions outlined in the
relevant exemption case are met, as summarised in Table 1 below. 1
Article 61(4) states "In addition, clinical investigations need not be
performed in the cases referred to in paragraph
6". The words "in addition" indicates additional exemption cases which
do not rely on the exemption criteria of Article 61(4) being met. i.e.,
CASE 2 and CASE 3, as described in Article 61(6)(a) and Article
61(6)(b), do not need to satisfy the additional requirements listed in
Article 61(4). Article 61(5) states "a manufacturer [...] may also
rely on paragraph 4 in order not to perform a clinical investigation
provided that the following conditions are fulfilled in addition to what
is required in that paragraph". This indicates that the exemption case
outlined in Article 61(5) is dependent on criteria described in Article
61(4) being met. In legal terms, the phrasing "may also rely upon"
indicates a dependence on the referenced paragraph; Article 61(5) has a
dependency on Article 61(4), but Articles 61(4) and 61(6) are not
dependent on Article 61(5). 2 It can be inferred from this independence
of paragraphs that the devices described in CASE 1 and CASE 4 are
neither legacy devices as outlined in CASE 2 nor "sutures, staples,
dental fillings, dental braces, tooth crowns, screws, wedges, plates,
wires, pins, clips or connectors" as outlined in CASE 3. i.e., the DUE
described in Article 61(5) and indents 1-3 of Article 61(4) are new
devices which have not previously been marketed under either the
Directives or the MDR. 3 N.B., in CASE 4, a contract with at least one
manufacturer will be required along with the other conditions described
in Table 1. However, data from other manufacturers' devices (with which
equivalence is demonstrated) can be used without a contract to
supplement the data in the clinical evaluation, for those indications
covered by the contract. See also footnote 11.

clinical investigations for implantable and class III devices CASE 1: •
DUE has been designed by modifications of a device already Indents 1-3
of marketed by the same manufacturer. Article 61(4) • Equivalence is
demonstrated between the DUE and the manufacturer's ED in accordance
with Section 3 of Annex XIV; demonstration of equivalence has been
endorsed by the notified body. For further guidance on the demonstration
of equivalence, please refer to MDCG 2020-5. • The clinical evaluation
of the marketed device is sufficient to demonstrate conformity of the
modified device with the relevant safety and performance requirements4,
5. • PMCF plan is appropriate and includes post market studies to
demonstrate the safety and performance of the DUE6. CASE 2: • DUE has
been lawfully placed on the market or put into service in Article
accordance with Directive 90/385/EEC or Directive 93/42/EEC. 61(6)(a) •
The clinical evaluation is based on sufficient clinical data7. • The
clinical evaluation is in compliance with the relevant productspecific
CS for the clinical evaluation of that kind of device, where such a CS
is available. CASE 3: • DUE is one of the listed types of devices:
"sutures, staples, Article dental fillings, dental braces, tooth crowns,
screws, wedges, 61(6)(b) plates, wires, pins, clips or connectors". •
The clinical evaluation is based on sufficient clinical data7. • The
clinical evaluation is in compliance with the relevant productspecific
CS for the clinical evaluation of that kind of device, where such a CS
is available. CASE 4: • Equivalence is demonstrated between the DUE and
the other Article 61(5)8 manufacturer's ED in accordance with Section 3
of Annex XIV;
The MDR does not prohibit the use of data from another manufacturer's ED
in the clinical evaluation of the manufacturer's already marketed
device. This does not imply that a manufacturer will rely on equivalence
in perpetuity: the additional requirement for PMCF studies to
demonstrate the safety and performance of the DUE ensures that clinical
data on the DUE itself will be collected post market; this data will be
included in future revisions of the clinical evaluation report per
Article 61(11). There may however be circumstances in which it is
appropriate to continue to include data from EDs in the clinical
evaluation, even when clinical data has been generated on the DUE. 5 The
clinical evaluation for the manufacturer's ED does not supersede the
clinical evaluation for the DUE; the DUE clinical evaluation and its
documentation are still required, in accordance with Article 61(1). 6
See also MDCG 2020-8: Post-market clinical follow-up (PMCF) Evaluation
Report Template - A guide for manufacturers and notified bodies (April
2020) 7 "Clinical data" includes data from any of the sources listed in
the Article 2(48) definition. This includes data from "a device for
which equivalence to the device in question can be demonstrated". The
definition does not include a requirement for a contract between the
manufacturers. Additional note: MedDev 2.12/2 indicated that PMCF
studies should be undertaken for devices when the clinical evaluation
was based on equivalence. In some cases, execution of such studies may
have been a condition of certification under the Directives. The
acceptance of clinical evidence from EDs as part of the clinical
evidence package to support MDR certification does not invalidate any
such conditions of certification. 8 Article 61(5) states: "A
manufacturer of a device demonstrated to be equivalent to an already
marketed device not manufactured by him, may also rely on paragraph 4 in
order not to perform a clinical investigation provided that the
following conditions are fulfilled in addition to what is required in
that paragraph"; i.e., the exemption requirements of Article 61(4) must
also be met in addition to the exemption requirements laid out in
Article 61(5). This does not include the requirement for the device to
be a design modification of the manufacturer's own already marketed
device. 4

demonstration of equivalence has been endorsed by the notified body (via
Article 61(4)). The clinical data from the clinical evaluation of the ED
is sufficient to support the intended purposes of the DUE (via Article
61(4))9. The two manufacturers have a contract in place that explicitly
allows the manufacturer of the ED full access to the technical
documentation on an ongoing basis. The clinical evaluation of the other
manufacturer's ED has been performed in compliance with the requirements
of the MDR10, 11. PMCF plan is appropriate and includes post market
studies to demonstrate the safety and performance of the DUE6 (via
Article 61(4)).
In the case where a clinical investigation(s) is determined to be
mandatory12 in order to obtain the needed clinical data to support the
clinical evidence for a claimed indication for use, the MDR does not
specify the number or extent of the clinical investigation(s) required.
However, as a minimum, mandatory clinical investigation(s) should be
understood to mean a pivotal clinical investigation(s) generating
pivotal data. 5. Demonstration of "sufficient levels of access to the
data" required to justify claims of equivalence In addition to outlining
the technical, biological and clinical characteristics to be taken into
consideration for the demonstration of equivalence, Annex XIV Section 3
MDR requires manufacturers to have "[...] sufficient levels of access
to the data relating to devices with which they are claiming equivalence
in order to justify their claims of equivalence". As clarified above,
demonstration of "sufficient levels of access" does not require a
contract in all circumstances. A contract is only required for the
exemption case described in Article 61(5). It should also be noted that
Annex XIV Section 3 refers specifically to the data required to justify
claims of equivalence: i.e., the requirement is for sufficient access to
establish the clinical, technical and biological characteristics against
which equivalence is evaluated, not access to the complete technical
documentation. A contract as described in Article 61(5) is presumed to
provide full access to the data needed for the demonstration of
equivalence. However, in the cases where a contract is not required,
other means of access to data can prove to be adequate to support
demonstrations of equivalence. This includes CASEs 1, 2, and 3; it also
includes a specific subset of CASE 4, in which equivalence is fully
demonstrated with more than one device from more than one manufacturer,
and there is a contract in place with at 9 The MDR does not prohibit the
use of equivalence, demonstrated in compliance with the MDR, in the
clinical
evaluation of ED. 10 The clinical evaluation for the other
manufacturer's ED does not supersede the clinical evaluation for the
DUE; the DUE clinical evaluation and its documentation are still
required, in accordance with Article 61(1). 11 The MDR does not prohibit
the use of clinical data from more than one manufacturer's ED in the
clinical evaluation of the DUE. In this case, only one contract with one
manufacturer is required for the exemption from the requirement for
clinical investigations to apply for the specific indications for use
covered by the existing contract. 12 Article 61(4) MDR

least one of the manufacturers, see footnotes 3 and 11. The manufacturer
of the DUE must document their justification within the CER as to why
the level of access they have obtained is sufficient, and this has to be
accepted by the notified body13. Table 2 in Appendix II provides some
examples of means of access to the data relevant for the demonstration
of equivalence and suggests a hierarchy in relation to the level of
access to this data. It also indicates potential limitations of these
methods and means by which these limitations might be addressed. Table 2
is for illustrative purposes only, and is not intended to be exhaustive
or prescriptive. N.B.: A higher level of access is indicated where
limitations are considered unacceptable and cannot be adequately
addressed. In this context, an unacceptable limitation is one which
compromises the completeness or accuracy of the demonstration of
equivalence such that it cannot be presumed that the DUE has similar
safety and performance characteristics to the device with which
equivalence is claimed. It should also be noted that a higher level of
access to data does not directly correlate to a stronger demonstration
of equivalence. For example, in example 1a of Table 2, the manufacturer
of the DUE has complete access to the data required to demonstrate
equivalence, but the devices could still have differences in one or more
of the clinical, technical or biological equivalence criteria described
in Annex XIV Section 3 of the MDR. By contrast, in the case described in
example 1d of Table 2, it may be presumed that the DUE is identical to
its claimed equivalent. If a manufacturer is not able to demonstrate
sufficient levels of access to the data needed for the demonstration of
equivalence, equivalence claims cannot be made for the purpose of
conformity assessment13.

This guidance document is not legally binding. It has been put together
following contribution from national competent authorities, industry and
relevant stakeholders and it should therefore be recognised as best
practice. It also intends to support a harmonised approach with respect
to clinical data providing sufficient clinical evidence necessary to
demonstrate conformity with the relevant General Safety and Performance
Requirements (GSPR) across European Union Member States. 1. Definitions
1.1. Terms defined in MDR Article 2 The following terms are used as
defined in the Medical Device Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (MDR): 
'performance';1  'risk';2  'intended purpose'3  'benefit-risk
determination';4  'clinical evaluation';5  'clinical investigation';6
 'clinical data';7  'clinical evidence';8  'clinical performance';9
It should be noted that clinical performance may arise from either
'direct or indirect medical effects' 'leading to a clinical benefit for
patients'; see comments for relevance to clinical benefit below 
'clinical benefit'.10 It should be noted that clinical benefits may be
either direct or indirect; for example devices such as guidewires may
assist other medical devices in achieving their intended purpose,
without having a direct therapeutic or diagnostic function themselves. 
'generic device group'.11 1.2. Additional terms not defined in MDR

'legacy devices': this is considered to include all devices previously
CE marked under the European Medical Devices Directive 93/42/EEC (MDD)
or Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive 90/385/EEC (AIMDD)
'well-established technology': this terminology is used in Article 52(5)
and Article 61(8) of the MDR, but is not defined in these articles. The
term is not restricted to the devices listed in Article 61(6b); Article
61(8) explicitly states that this includes devices similar to the
exempted devices listed in Article 61(6b), which might be added to that
list in future. The common features of the devices which are
wellestablished technologies are that they all have: o relatively
simple, common and stable designs with little evolution; o their generic
device group has well-known safety and has not been associated with
safety issues in the past; o well-known clinical performance
characteristics and their generic device group are standard of care
devices where there is little evolution in indications and the state of
the art; o a long history on the market. Therefore, any devices that
meet all these criteria may be considered "wellestablished
technologies". 'scientific validity', 'scientifically valid': this
terminology is used in the MDR in reference to clinical data planning,
evaluation and conclusions 12. Clinical evaluations must follow a
"defined and methodologically sound procedure"13, for which expectations
of scientific validity are implicit. Embedded in the term 'scientific
validity' are concepts including adequacy of study design and controls
for bias, appropriateness and relevance of research questions, adequacy
of sample sizes and statistical analyses, completeness of data, adequacy
of follow up period, and appropriateness of conclusions on the basis of
objective evidence. Section 9.3.1 of MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev. 4 provides
guidance for the evaluation of methodological quality and scientific
validity under the MDD/AIMDD which are equally valid under the MDR which
can be considered to apply when referencing 'scientific validity' in
this guidance. 'level of clinical evidence': this terminology is used in
the MDR with respect to requirements for demonstration of conformity
with the relevant GSPR and overall benefit-risk14. It is understood to
encompass the amount and quality of evidence (i.e. its characterisation
by quality, quantity, completeness and statistical validity, etc.)
required to demonstrate safety, performance and the benefit-risk
conclusion of a medical device. It should not be confused with the term
'levels of evidence' (as used in evidence-based medicine) which is used
to rank study designs, and is only a part of the concept 'level of
clinical evidence'. Regarding the assessment of the level of clinical
evidence for the device in question, see sections 6.3 and 6.5d of this
document. 'state of the art': IMDRF/GRRP WG/N47 provides the following
definition: Developed stage of current technical capability and/or
accepted clinical practice in regard to products, processes and patient
management, based on the relevant consolidated findings of science,
technology and experience.

Note: The state-of-the-art embodies what is currently and generally
accepted as good practice in technology and medicine. The
state-of-the-art does not necessarily imply the most technologically
advanced solution. The state-of-the-art described here is sometimes
referred to as the "generally acknowledged state-ofthe-art 'intended
use': The MDR defines 'intended purpose', but not 'intended use'.
'intended use' should be considered to have the same meaning as
'intended purpose'. 'indication', 'indication for use': refers to the
clinical condition that is to be diagnosed, prevented, monitored,
treated, alleviated, compensated for, replaced, modified or controlled
by the medical device. It should be distinguished from 'intended
purpose/intended use', which describes the effect of a device. All
devices have an intended purpose/intended use, but not all devices have
an indication (e.g. medical devices with an intended purpose of
disinfection or sterilisation of devices). 'similar device': devices
belonging to the same generic device group. The MDR defines this as a
set of devices having the same or similar intended purposes or a
commonality of technology allowing them to be classified in a generic
manner not reflecting specific characteristics15.

the requirements of MDR Chapter VI and Annex XIV, and references the
following MDD/AIMDD guidance documents:  MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev. 4: Clinical
Evaluation: A Guide for Manufacturers and Notified Bodies under
Directives 93/42/EEC and 90/385/EEC  MEDDEV 2.12/2 rev 2: Post Market
Clinical Follow-Up Studies: A Guide for Manufacturers and Notified
Bodies 3. Scope This document seeks to provide guidance for clinical
data providing sufficient clinical evidence necessary to demonstrate
conformity with the relevant GSPR, as per Article 61(1) MDR, for legacy
devices CE marked with respect to Directives 93/42/EEC (MDD) or
90/385/EEC (AIMDD). This document aims to provide guidance for
manufacturers and notified bodies to prepare for the conformity
assessment procedure according to the MDR. This document does not
provide comprehensive guidance with respect to the process or
methodology relating to clinical evaluation. It is general and not
restricted to any particular device technology or risk class. Following
on from the principles described in Section 3 however, special attention
is given to those described in Article 61(6).

4. Introduction and context This section is intended to provide an
introduction and context, and not to modify the interpretation of the
MDR. MDR Article 61(1) states: Confirmation of conformity with relevant
general safety and performance requirements set out in Annex I under the
normal conditions of the intended use of the device, and the evaluation
of the undesirable side-effects and of the acceptability of the
benefit-risk ratio referred to in Sections 1 and 8 of Annex I, shall be
based on clinical data providing sufficient clinical evidence, including
where applicable relevant data as referred to in Annex III. The
manufacturer shall specify and justify the level of clinical evidence
necessary to demonstrate conformity with the relevant general safety and
performance requirements. That level of clinical evidence shall be
appropriate in view of the characteristics of the device and its
intended purpose. To that end, manufacturers shall plan, conduct and
document a clinical evaluation in accordance with this Article and Part
A of Annex XIV. MDR Article 61(4) states that clinical investigations
shall be performed for Class III and implantable devices, but distinct
exemptions from this requirement are identified both in this article and
in Articles 61(5) and 61(6). The common theme of these exempted devices
is that they have been previously marketed (Article 61(6)) or have been
demonstrated to be equivalent to devices previously marketed (Article
61(5)). Article 61(6a and b) further distinguishes between legacy
devices (Article 61(6a)) which have been previously marketed under
93/42/EEC or 90/385/EEC and a specific subset of well-established
technologies (WET) (Article 61(6b)). The following should be noted: 
all such exemptions from clinical investigations require that the
clinical evaluation is based on "sufficient clinical data";  the basic
clinical evaluation requirements for the legacy devices described in
Article 61(6a) and the devices of Article 61(6b) are the same:
"sufficient clinical data" and compliance to common specifications where
these exist. The distinction between the two is that the devices listed
in Article 61(6b) are not explicitly required to have had prior
certification under the Directives to be exempted from the requirement
for clinical investigations that otherwise apply to Class III and
implantable devices;  both the Directives and the MDR require the
quantity and quality of clinical data to be sufficient to demonstrate
safety, performance and the acceptability of the benefit-risk ratio:
both the Directives and the MDR require clinical evidence to be sound
and the conclusions derived from this evidence to be scientifically
valid. Article 61(10)16 allows for the use of non-clinical data for
demonstration of conformity with GSPRs: Without prejudice to paragraph
4,where the demonstration of conformity with general safety and
performance requirements based on clinical data is not deemed
16

Article 61(10).

appropriate, adequate justification for any such exception shall be
given based on the results of the manufacturer's risk management and on
consideration of the specifics of the interaction between the device and
the human body, the clinical performance intended and the claims of the
manufacturer. Article 61(10) cannot be applied to Class III or
implantable devices. In exceptional cases Article 61(10) may be applied
for all other device classifications. 5. General aspects "Sufficient
clinical evidence" is not defined in the MDR. The definition of
"clinical evidence" itself contains the word "sufficient" but it is
related to the amount and quality of the clinical data and the clinical
evaluation results which "allow a qualified assessment of whether the
device is safe and achieves the intended clinical benefits when used as
intended by the manufacturer".17 Sufficient clinical evidence is also
mentioned in the MDR Article 61 where it is provided that the
confirmation of conformity with the relevant GSPR shall be based on
sufficient clinical evidence. Therefore, "sufficient clinical evidence"
is understood as "the present result of the qualified assessment which
has reached the conclusion that the device is safe and achieves the
intended benefits". It is important to note that clinical evaluation is
a process where this qualified assessment has to be done on a continuous
basis. Compared to Directives 93/42/EEC and 90/385/EEC, MDR provides
greater detail and additional requirements with respect to the process
of clinical evaluation, for the purpose of confirmation of conformity
with relevant GSPR. The generation of clinical data and their evaluation
providing sufficient clinical evidence is part of a lifecycle approach
to medical devices. The MDR reinforces a number of important factors
which are relevant to clinical evaluation. This includes:  



Consideration of available alternative treatment options is required for
the confirmation of the acceptability of the benefit-risk ratio.18 The
acceptability of the benefit-risk ratio must be based upon clinical data
providing sufficient clinical evidence including where applicable
relevant data from post-market surveillance.19 The term "clinical
evidence" is introduced and the level of clinical evidence must be
specified and justified by the manufacturer, taking the characteristics
of the device and the intended purpose into account.20 The incorporation
of post market surveillance (PMS) data in particular the post-market
clinical follow-up (PMCF) data into the process of clinical evaluation.
21 Manufacturers are required to establish a post-market surveillance
plan in accordance with Annex III of the MDR and the clinical data
arising from this PMS shall be incorporated into the clinical
evaluation. The definition of equivalence is now included in the text of
the MDR,22 and the process to demonstrate equivalence is defined23.

 A definition of "clinical data" is provided.24 When it comes to the
first MDR conformity assessment of a legacy device the pre-market and
post-market clinical data generated for the purpose of MDD/AIMDD can be
taken into account. As requirements and guidance developed over time, it
is not necessarily the case that the clinical data used for conformity
assessment under the Directives is clinical data providing sufficient
clinical evidence for the purpose of MDR requirements. Legacy devices
which have been placed on the market have been subjected to conformity
assessment and therefore are presumed to have been supported by clinical
data25. Postmarket clinical data together with the clinical data
generated for the conformity assessment under the MDD/AIMDD will be the
basis of the clinical evaluation process for legacy devices under the
MDR. During the period of validity of the MDD/AIMDD certificates, the
MDR requirements for the PMS apply from the MDR date of application.
Legacy devices are therefore not exempted from the additional
requirements in MDR concerning PMS, including PMCF. PMS data and
clinical evaluation plans and reports need to be produced and updated.
The MDR compliant clinical evaluation for a legacy device must contain
the identification of available clinical data as well as their appraisal
/ analysis / evaluation and shall lead to a demonstration of conformity
to the MDR GSPR based on clinical data providing sufficient clinical
evidence as part of a lifecycle approach. The European Commission
guidance MEDDEV 2.12/2 regarding PMCF studies notes different instances
where a PMCF study may have been justified: 26 
Route chosen for clinical evaluation: where CE marking for legacy
devices was based upon equivalence, PMCF studies may have been
necessary. The European Commission guidance MEDDEV 2.12/2 regarding PMCF
also notes that in the case that clinical evaluation was based
exclusively on clinical data from equivalent devices for initial
conformity assessment, the certifying notified body shall verify that
PMCF studies have been conducted,27 in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the Directives.28  Device related factors: There are a
number of device-related factors where PMCF studies may have been
necessary. 29 When assessing the conformity of legacy devices under the
MDR, it is important to verify whether PMCF studies considered necessary
under the MDD/AIMDD (and where applicable, during the transition period,
under the MDR), have been appropriately conducted, and results are taken
fully into account for in the clinical evaluation for the conformity
assessment under MDR. Guidance on the general process of conducting
clinical evaluation is also available in the MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev. 4. This
guidance was written with respect to the MDD and AIMDD to provide
practical guidance on several scientific and clinical aspects that are
relevant for conducting clinical evaluation. However only the text of
the MDR is authentic in law, sections relevant to the MDR are listed in
Appendix I to this document.

6. Guidance on specific aspects of clinical evaluation for legacy
devices Sections 6.1 -- 6.5 below provide guidance on each stage of the
clinical evaluation process of MDR Annex XIV Part A Section 1. 6.1.
Annex XIV Part A Section 1a: Establish or update a clinical evaluation
plan 30 Manufacturers are required to document a clinical evaluation
plan to meet the requirements of MDR Annex XIV Section 1a. Premarket
elements of the plan as described in the final indent of MDR Annex XIV
Section 1a (first-in-man studies, feasibility and pilot studies) are not
generally relevant to legacy devices which are unchanged in design or
indications. However, the context for the plan as described in indents
1-7 and the basis for the PMCF as described in indent 8 of MDR Annex XIV
Section 1a are considered relevant and necessary for demonstration of
compliance to the MDR. Appendix II of this guidance document suggests a
minimum content for clinical evaluation plans for legacy devices.
Further advice regarding specific sub-indents of MDR Annex XIV Section
1a are provided below. a. Identification of the relevant GSPRs (indent 1
of MDR Annex XIV Section 1a): clinical evaluation planning under the
Directives required an identification of the relevant Essential
Requirements (ER) for which demonstration of conformity required
clinical data. The manufacturer should conduct an analysis with respect
to the GSPRs of the MDR, to determine if additional data to support the
clinical evidence are required to meet additional MDR requirements. This
could be achieved either through a gap analysis with respect to new MDR
requirements, or by creation of an entirely new analysis for the MDR. As
noted in Section 3, Article 61(10) cannot be applied to Class III or
implantable devices, but may be applied to some or all requirements for
confirmation of conformity with relevant GSPRs for all other device
classifications if adequately justified. b. Specification of the
intended purpose, target groups, indications, contraindications (indents
2-3 of MDR Annex XIV Section 1a): Appendix A3 of MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev. 4
lists additional information to Annex II of the MDR about device
description that can be relevant for planning clinical evaluations. The
manufacturer needs to ensure that inputs for the clinical evaluation
plan are in line with the device's "label, instructions for use,
promotional or sales materials or statements"31 and with the device's
updated risk management documents. c. Detailed description of intended
clinical benefits with relevant and specified clinical outcome
parameters (indent 4 of MDR Annex XIV Section 1a): MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev. 4
Appendix A7.2 Section b provides relevant additional information with
respect to the definition of clinical benefits. MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev. 4
Appendix A7.2 Section c provides relevant information with respect to
the quantification of benefits and determination of relevant outcome
parameters, which may be useful for clinical evaluation planning. d.
Specification of qualitative and quantitative aspects of clinical safety
and performance (indents 5-7 of MDR Annex XIV Section 1a): The level of
clinical evidence required for the device under evaluation needs to be
determined by the manufacturer and verified by the notified body. The
level of clinical evidence shall
30 31
MDR, Annex XIV, Part A, section 1. MDR, Article 2 (12).
Page 10 of 22
be appropriate in view of the characteristics of the device and its
intended purpose.32 The proposed level of clinical evidence should take
into account the specification of methods to be used for examination of
qualitative and quantitative aspects of clinical performance and
clinical safety with clear reference to the determination of residual
risks and side-effects. MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev. 4 appendix A6 describes
examples of studies that lack scientific validity for the demonstration
of adequate clinical performance and/or clinical safety. MEDDEV 2.7/1
rev. 4 section 9.3.2 also provides relevant guidance. It also has to
take into account the intended clinical benefits to patients with
relevant and specified clinical outcome parameters as well as an
indicative list and specification of parameters to be used to determine,
based on the state of the art in medicine, the acceptability of the
benefit-risk ratio for the various indications and for the intended
purpose or purposes of the device. 33 For medical devices which have
been subject to conformity assessment according to Directives, it should
be possible to provide a clear justification for the level of clinical
evidence required to reach a demonstration of conformity based on
clinical data providing sufficient clinical evidence at the end of the
data analysis stage. Manufacturers should identify benefits and risks of
the device under evaluation, take into account available alternative
treatment options and a clinical assessment of residual risks associated
with the device before justifying the level of clinical evidence. As an
outcome of this step, it should be possible to conclude if the device is
one which has a clearly positive benefit--risk determination, when
alternatives are considered, or a marginal one. Special attention is
required, with respect to devices with a marginal benefit-risk, at both
the stage of initial conformity assessment and when designing the
post-market surveillance or clinical follow-up of the device. According
to the MDR, parameters to be used to "determine.... the acceptability of
the benefit-risk ratio for the various indications and for the intended
purpose or purposes of the device" need to be based on the state of the
art in medicine.34 Section 8.2. of MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev. 4 indicates how
data on the current state of the art in medicine can be identified. 6.2.
Annex XIV Part A Section 1b: Identify available clinical data 35 It is
important to identify all available sources of clinical data from both
the pre-market and post-market phases. This will include all of the
clinical data which is generated and held by the manufacturer as well as
clinical data for equivalent or similar devices36. Clinical data is
defined in the MDR and the sources of data are specified in Article
2(48). Sections 6.2.1 and 6.2.3 below provide additional guidance with
respect to the use of these data sources for legacy devices. It should
be noted that, apart from devices for which Article 61(10) may be
applied, the MDR requires confirmation of conformity with the relevant
GSPRs to be based on clinical data as defined in Article 2(48). However,
other types of data may provide supportive or clarifying information:
this may include data derived through evaluation of state of the art,

evaluation of clinical data for similar devices (as described in Section
1.2 of this document), usability or simulated use testing, etc. A
summary of considerations related to use of clinical and non-clinical
data sources is provided in Appendix III of this document. 6.2.1.
Pre-market sources of clinical data For the purpose of legacy devices,
pre-market sources of clinical data may include:  Clinical
investigation reports of the device concerned;  Clinical investigation
reports or other studies reported in scientific literature, of a device
for which equivalence to the device in question can be demonstrated in
accordance with the MDR;  Reports published in peer reviewed scientific
literature on other clinical experience of either the device in question
or a device for which equivalence to the device in question can be
demonstrated;  Other pre-market data, e.g. case reports on experience
with the use of the device in question, such as compassionate or
humanitarian exceptional use reports. Note that this kind of pre-market
data may be more prone to bias, compared to those listed above. It
should be noted that MDR Article 2(48) provides a narrower definition of
what constitutes clinical data sources as compared to the Directives
which allow unpublished reports on other clinical experience to
contribute to the clinical evaluation. Such data sources may provide
informative context for the clinical evaluation of legacy devices.
6.2.2. Post-market sources of clinical data Post-market sources of
clinical data refer to data collected following the initial CE marking
under the Directives (or prior to introduction of a new indication or
design variant). This may include:  PMS clinical data, complaint and
incident reports;  PMCF studies, including post-market clinical
investigations;  Independent clinical studies conducted using the
device37;  Device registries;  Data retrieved from the literature. For
well-established technologies the clinical evaluation can be based on
data coming from similar devices, under the conditions detailed in
paragraph 6.5 (e). With respect to legacy devices, when clinical data
from equivalent devices is used, equivalence must be demonstrated
according to the requirements of the MDR. 38,39 6.3. Annex XIV Part A
Section 1c: Appraisal of the clinical data The clinical data sets should
be subject to an appraisal with respect to their relative contribution
to the overall clinical evaluation. It is important to perform analysis
of the methodological quality of data obtained from different sources to
identify and assess the level of evidence, bias, other inherent weakness
or other possible shortcomings. Clinical investigations, other sources
of clinical data and post-market sources of clinical data can be of
variable methodological quality and therefore an appraisal of the design
of
37
Including for example devices used during clinical trials of
pharmaceutical substances, or accessories to other medical devices,
where the device is clearly identified. 38 MDR, Annex XIV and Article
2(48). 39 MDCG 2020-5 Clinical Evaluation -- Equivalence, A guide for
manufacturers and notified bodies.

these studies is important. Examples of studies that lack scientific
validity for demonstration of adequate clinical performance and / or
clinical safety can be found in Appendix A6 General principles of
clinical evaluation of MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev. 4. The use of vigilance data,
in general is appropriate for identification of any new risks, events in
subpopulations, examining trends in PMS reports etc. With respect to the
utilisation of post-market surveillance data for the purpose of
conformity assessment, it is important to recognise that uncontrolled
sources of clinical data -- for example complaint or incident report
data -- cannot always provide reliable data with respect to the
incidence of risks and cannot provide an estimate of uncertainty i.e. a
confidence interval. Due to limitations of complaints reporting, the use
of estimates such as [number of incidents or complaints] / [number of
device sales] cannot generally be considered sufficient to provide
proof of safety; their use should be limited to cases where data from
pre-market or post-market clinical investigations or PMCF studies are
not deemed appropriate. Additional information on the use of information
derived from vigilance data, device registry data, case series, patient
dossiers and other use data can be found in section 9.3.1 (c) of MEDDEV
2.7/1 rev. 4. Clinical data appraisal should be conducted using
verified/validated assessment tools. Examples include methodological
quality assessment tools developed by medical researchers and scientists
to assess published clinical data such as Appendix F of IMDRF MDCE
WG/N56 on Clinical Evaluation, Cochrane Collaboration's tool for
Randomized Controlled Trials (RTC), MINORS (Methodological index for
non-randomized studies), Reisch tool (for non-randomized interventional
studies), Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for assessing the quality of
nonrandomised studies in meta-analyses. Their detailed description, the
inclusive list of major components of each tool is included in the paper
by Zeng X, Zhang Y, Kwong JS et al. "The methodological quality
assessment tools for preclinical and clinical studies, systematic review
and meta-analysis, and clinical practice guideline: a systematic
review"40. This list is not exhaustive. Additional validated tools may
become available in the future. 6.4. Annex XIV Part A Section 1d:
Generation of new clinical data Legacy devices following the MEDDEV
2.12/2 guidance for PMCF should normally have collected data on the
devices themselves in the post-market phase. In the event that the
postmarket data on the device itself (including PMCF) is not adequately
comprehensive to provide sufficient clinical evidence, and the
demonstration of equivalence is no longer possible under the definition
of equivalence in the MDR, new data may need to be generated prior to
CE-marking under the MDR. In general, there shall be sufficient clinical
evidence to confirm safety, performance and the acceptability of the
benefit-risk determination in relation to the state of the art for the
legacy devices prior to CE-marking under the MDR, and such demonstration
should not rely on new PMCF studies started under the MDR to bridge gaps
(e.g. indications not supported by clinical evidence). Where other
evidence, for example results of pre-clinical testing etc. as described
in MDR Article 61(10), is used for confirmation of safety and
performance, PMCF studies may be undertaken to confirm these
conclusions.

6.5. Annex XIV Part A Section 1e: Analysis of the clinical data The aim
of this stage is the determination if all clinical data collected and
appraised, as described in previous stages, demonstrate together
conformity with relevant GSPR. In order to determine the benefit-risk
ratio, it is necessary to identify the benefits and risks associated
with the device and the alternatives (if any). Practical guidance is
available in section 10 of MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev. 4.41 Demonstration of
compliance with the GSPR, relevant for the device in question have to be
based on:    
The usage of reliable, justified and sound analytical methods (where
applicable qualitative, quantitative, or both); Results of performed
comprehensive analysis; Identification of any missing data and/or gaps;
Determination of PMCF needs.
a. Clinical benefits Clinical benefit means "the positive impact of a
device on the health of an individual, expressed in terms of a
meaningful, measurable, patient-relevant clinical outcome(s), including
outcome(s) related to diagnosis, or a positive impact on patient
management or public health".42 The type of clinical benefit associated
with a device depends upon the device under evaluation and its intended
purpose. Examples of clinical benefits and their quantification can be
found in Appendix A7.2 letters (b) and (c) of MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev. 4. It
should be noted that while direct clinical benefits should be supported
by clinical data, indirect clinical benefits may be demonstrable by
other evidence such as: 
pre-clinical and bench test data (eg compliance to product standards or
common specifications);  real world data such as registries,
information deriving from insurance database records, etc;  data from
another device that is used with the subject device which does have
direct clinical data (eg, data from a stent used to justify safety and
performance of a guidewire). A determination of the level of clinical
evidence required to demonstrate an indirect clinical benefit should be
made on the basis of a thorough risk assessment and evaluation of short,
medium and long term clinical risks (for example, a guidewire, although
used transiently, may have long term clinical risks if it leads to
vessel dissection). b. Risks Risk means the combination of the
probability of occurrence of harm and the severity of that harm.43 The
MDR requires manufacturers to establish, document, implement and
maintain a system for risk management.44 The standard ISO 1497145
provides such a process for managing risks associated with medical
devices, as part of an ongoing,
41
This chapter includes references to the MDD, MDR requirements should be
used instead, ie. reference to 'Essential requirements' should be
replaced by GSPR and reference to PMCF should be replaced by the
relevant MDR requirements, i.e. in Annex XIV, part B. 42 MDR, Article
2(53). 43 MDR, Article 2(23). 44 MDR, Article 10(2). 45 Medical devices
--- Application of risk management to medical devices.

lifecycle approach. The Annex I of the MDR require that manufacturers
reduce risks as far as possible, and to do this, manufacturers must
estimate and evaluate the risks associated with, and occurring during,
the intended use and during reasonably foreseeable misuse.46 The
determination as to which risks require the generation of clinical data
to support either the probability and severity of a particular harm, or
the effectiveness of a risk control measure, is one which must be
reached upon a case by case basis,47 and the decision as to when it is
necessary to generate further clinical data is not addressed by ISO
14971 and should be an output of the process of clinical evaluation.
Considerations on aspects of risk evaluation, and considerations on the
number of patients needed to obtain sufficient data can be found in
Appendix A7 of MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev. 4. c. Benefit-risk determination, state
of the art, alternative treatment options The MDR requires that any
risks which may be associated with the use of the device are "compatible
with a high level of protection of health and safety, taking into
account the generally acknowledged state of the art"48 and that the
determination of the acceptability of the benefit-risk ratio is "based
on the state of the art in medicine".49 It is important to remember that
a medical device may be used for an indication for which there are many
alternative medical options. This may include the use of medicinal
products, other medical devices, other medical or allied health
professional interventions, a combination of any of these or no
intervention. As such, in order to determine a benefitrisk ratio,
up-to-date alternatives must be considered for legacy devices. The
appropriateness and relevance of an alternative treatment option depends
upon a wide range of factors, including the nature of the healthcare
system and patient preferences. To help to describe alternatives, it is
necessary to describe the 'state of the art' for the treatment of the
indicated clinical condition taking alternative treatments into account.
The state of the art in this context can be taken to mean the generally
accepted most effective treatment option, for the intended purpose
relevant to the device under consideration. Occasionally, this may be
subject to differences of opinion between clinical evaluators as to what
is the state of the art, and where such differences exist, these should
be described and taken into account insofar as is possible. In such
cases, a thorough evaluation of the results from published clinical
studies of high methodological quality shall be taken into account.
Moreover, where applicable, particular attention shall be paid to
therapy guidelines grounded on principles of evidence based medicine.
Novel and innovative device technology may be subject to a rapidly
evolving state of the art for a particular indication, and where this
exists, it should also be noted. Aspects that influence the
acceptability of benefits and risks can be found in Appendix A7.2 letter
(e) and in Appendix A7.4 of MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev. 4.
46
MDR, Annex I, Chapter 1, section 3(c). ISO14971:2007, page v, notes that
an individual's perception of risk can depend upon a range of factors
including their cultural background, the socio-economic and educational
background of the society concerned, the actual and perceived state of
health of the patient, and many other factors. 48 MDR, Annex I, Chapter
1, Section 1. 49 MDR, Annex XIV, Part A, Section 1(a). 47

d. The level of clinical evidence available to demonstrate conformity
based on clinical data providing sufficient clinical evidence The MDR
requires that the level of clinical evidence is justified and specified
by the manufacturer. The required level of clinical evidence has to be
identified, specified and justified by the manufacturer during the
clinical evaluation process. This level has to be appropriate to
demonstrate conformity with the relevant GSPR. To reach a determination
of sufficiency, when considering the available level of clinical
evidence, the manufacturer may use widely available and validated tools
when examining clinical data. These tools are methodological quality
assessment tools developed by medical researchers and scientists to
assess published clinical data. 50 Examples of these tools include the
Cochrane Collaboration´s tool for RCT or NOS checklist for analytical
studies (see Footnote 40). See MEDDEV 2.7.1 rev 4, Section 9.3.2 'How to
determine the relevance of a data set for the clinical evaluation', for
further information. e. Lack of clinical data providing sufficient
clinical evidence Manufacturers should conduct a gap analysis with
respect to the MDR requirements. If data gaps have been identified,
there are different possibilities to bridge those gaps. While controlled
clinical investigations might be the preferred method for collecting
clinical data as part of the PMCF studies for some products, there are
other possibilities to gather relevant clinical data in the field in
order to close the clinical data gap. Other alternatives include, but
are not limited to systematic reviews of clinical data published in the
literature, evaluation of results from PMCF studies such as clinically
relevant scientifically sound questionnaires51 or registries.
Scientifically sound studies will normally include (note, this is not a
complete list):  
Clearly stated research question(s), objective(s) and related endpoints;
An evaluation of potential sources of bias or study distortion, and the
impact of these factors on the potential validity of results;  Design
with an appropriate rationale and statistical analysis plan;  A plan
for an analysis of the data and for drawing appropriate conclusion(s).
If there is not sufficient supportive clinical evidence with regard to
the declared intended purpose52 including the indications and claims as
appropriate, manufacturers shall narrow the intended purpose of the
device under evaluation until it is supported by the available clinical
evidence. As noted in Section 4, some legacy devices may have limited
clinical data, particularly if they were marketed prior to the
publication of the Directives. In some cases, it may be necessary for
the manufacturer to undertake PMCF to generate new data for these legacy
devices prior to CE marking under the MDR, whereas in other cases,
particularly for low risk standard of care devices where there is little
evolution in the state of the art, it may be possible to demonstrate
conformity with the relevant GSPRs with a more limited clinical data
set. Devices previously certified under the Directives might not be
considered to have sufficient clinical data for certification under the
MDR. Reasons may include:
50

Clinically relevant and where possible validated. 52 MDR, Article 2(12).

changes in the state of the art data arising from PMS may identify new
risks or provide additional clarity with respect to indications and
contraindications devices previously certified under Quality System
annexes of the Directive may not have been sampled prior to an
application for MDR certification, and the clinical evidence therefore
not subject to Notified Body scrutiny the MDR introduces new
requirements on the use of equivalence, which may reduce the overall
volume of data available for demonstration of conformity with the
relevant GSPRs the MDR has a more explicit definition of what
constitutes clinical data, which may remove some data sources previously
used
Although the Directives indicate that data shall be collected in the
post-market phase for all devices53, in practise the data collected may
not meet MDR criteria, if the devices were considered standard of care
and were not associated with safety concerns. Stable, wellestablished
technologies that perform as intended and are not associated with safety
concerns, and where there has been no innovation, are less likely to be
the subject of research, and therefore literature data may be limited or
non-existent. In some cases, it may be necessary for the manufacturer to
undertake PMCF to generate new clinical data for these devices prior to
certification under the MDR, even if they are well-established and have
been on the market for several decades, to enable an evaluation of their
safety and clinical performance in relation to an evolving state of the
art. In exceptional cases, particularly for low risk standard of care
devices where there is little evolution in the state of the art, and the
device is identified as belonging to the group of 'well-established
technologies' (see section 1.2 and Appendix III in this document) a
lower level of clinical evidence may be justified to be sufficient for
the confirmation of conformity with relevant GSPRs. This may be
supported by clinical data from the PMS provided that there has been a
quality management system in place to systematically collect and analyse
any complaints and incident reports, and that the collected data support
the safety and performance of the device.

An indicative list and specification of parameters to be used to
determine, based on the state of the art in medicine, the acceptability
of the benefit-risk ratio for the various indications and for the
intended purpose or purposes of the device.

and performance have been observed with the legacy devices.61
54
MDR, Annex VII, 4.11. Appendix A3 of MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev. 4 lists
information that can be relevant for planning clinical evaluations. The
manufacturer needs to make sure that input for the clinical evaluation
plan are in line with the device's "label, instructions for use,
promotional or sales materials or statements" and with the device's
updated risk management documents. 56 In order to fully identify the
intended purpose(s) of a legacy device, the manufacturer needs to
consider the data that is foreseen on the label, in the instructions for
use or in promotional or sales materials or statements that are foreseen
for the device. Typical elements of the intended purpose can be found in
Appendix A3 of MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev. 4. 57 MDR, Article 61(3)(c). 58 MDR,
Article 61(1). 59 The proposed level of clinical evidence should take
into account the specification of methods to be used for examination of
qualitative and quantitative aspects of clinical safety with clear
reference to the determination of residual risks and side-effects. 60 To
determine the level of clinical evidence it is necessary to identify
benefits and risks of the device under evaluation and to take into
account available alternative treatment options, and a clinical
assessment of failure modes associated with the device. 61 MDR Article
83 and MDR Annex III. 55

Appendix III -- Suggested hierarchy of clinical evidence for
confirmation of conformity with relevant GSPRs under the MDR Sources of
pre- and post- market clinical data are described in Sections 6.2.1 and
6.2.2 of this document. Reference is also made to clinical evidence
which may provide contextual, supportive or clarifying information for
demonstration of conformity with the relevant GSPRs. A suggested
hierarchy of evidence and considerations to apply is provided in the
table below, ranked roughly in order from strongest to weakest (some
variations may apply dependent on the device, GSPR for which evidence is
required, and quality of individual data sources): Rank
Types of clinical data and Considerations / comments evidence
1
Results of high quality62 clinical investigations covering all device
variants, indications, patient populations, duration of treatment

2
Results of high quality Gaps must be justified / addressed with other
clinical investigations with evidence in line with an appropriate risk
some gaps assessment, and clinical safety, performance, benefit and
device claims.
This may not feasible or necessary for certain well-established devices
with broad indications (eg Class IIb legacy sutures, which could be used
in every conceivable patient population)
Assuming the gaps can be justified, there should be an appropriate PMCF
plan to address residual risks. Otherwise, manufacturers shall narrow
the intended purpose of the device until sufficient clinical data has
also been generated. 3
Outcomes from high quality Is there sufficient evidence of the quality
of the clinical data collection data collected by the registry64, 65?
systems such as registries63 Are the devices adequately represented? Are
the data appropriately stratified? Are the endpoints appropriate to the
safety, performances and endpoints identified in the clinical evaluation
plan?
4
Outcomes from studies with potential methodological flaws but where data
can still be quantified and 66 acceptability justified
Many literature sources fall into this category, due to limitations such
as missing information, publication bias, time lag bias, etc. This
applies equally to publications in the peer-reviewed scientific
literature. However, for legacy devices

where no safety or performance concerns have been identified, these
sources can be sufficient for confirmation of conformity to the relevant
GSPRs if appropriately appraised and the gaps are identified and
handled. High quality surveys may also fall into this category. Class
III legacy devices and implantable legacy devices which are not
well-established technologies should have sufficient clinical data as a
minimum at level 4. Those devices which are well-established
technologies may be able to confirm conformity with the relevant GSPRs
via an evaluation of cumulative evidence from additional sources as
listed below. Reliance solely on complaints and vigilance is not
sufficient. 5
Equivalence data (reliable / Equivalence must meet MDR criteria.

data on their own devices in the post-market phase, therefore reliance
on equivalence should be duly justified, and linked to appropriate PMCF
or proactive PMS.

Evaluation of state of the art, including evaluation of clinical data
from similar devices as defined in Section 1.2 of this document
7
Complaints and vigilance This falls within the definition of clinical
data data; curated data under MDR Article 2(48), but is not generally
considered a high quality source of data due to limitations in
reporting. It may be useful for identifying safety trends or performance
issues. High volume data collected within a robust quality system may
provide supportive evidence of device safety.

well-established technologies only can be considered supportive of
confirmation of conformity to the relevant GSPRs. Data from similar
devices may be also important to establish whether the device under
evaluation and similar devices belong to the group of devices considered
as "well established technologies" (WET). See section 1.2 in this
document for the criteria for WET. Data from similar devices may be
used, for example, to demonstrate ubiquity of design, lack of novelty,
known safety and performance profile of a generic group of devices, etc.

Introduction The Medical Device Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (MDR) considers
the post-market clinical follow-up (PMCF) as a continuous process that
updates the clinical evaluation and that shall be addressed in the
manufacturer's post-market surveillance (PMS) plan. The MDR reinforces
the PMCF process by the manufacturer, devoting part B of Annex XIV to it
and providing a set of requirements for developing a plan, necessary to
implement PMCF. A PMCF plan shall specify the methods and procedures set
up by the manufacturer, to proactively collect and evaluate clinical
data from the use in or on humans of a CE marked medical device, placed
on the market or put into service within its intended purpose, as
referred to in the relevant conformity assessment procedure. The aim of
the PMCF plan is:  confirming the safety1 and performance, including
the clinical benefit if applicable, of the device throughout its
expected lifetime;  identifying previously unknown side-effects and
monitor the identified side-effects and contraindications;  identifying
and analysing emergent risks on the basis of factual evidence; 
ensuring the continued acceptability of the benefit-risk ratio, referred
to in Section 1 and 9 of Annex I in the MDR;  identifying possible
systematic misuse or off-label use of the device, with a view to
verifying that the intended purpose is correct. The PMCF plan shall be
part of the post-market surveillance plan. The findings of the PMCF
shall be analysed by the manufacturer who shall document the results in
a PMCF evaluation report. The PMCF evaluation report shall be part of
the clinical evaluation report and the technical documentation. The
adequateness of the PMCF plan and its application is subject to
assessment by the notified body. The notified body's assessment of the
clinical evaluation shall also cover the manufacturer's procedures and
documentation of the PMCF, as well as the justification in relation to
non-performance of PMCF. The purpose of the present template is to guide
manufacturers in complying with the requirements of the MDR with respect
to the compilation of the PMCF plan. This would assist manufacturers in
a harmonised and complete presentation of post market clinical data and
facilitate the activity of notified bodies and competent authorities in
finding the information in an organised format. 1
The confirmation of the safety includes the acceptability of identified
risks and particularly residual risks.

activities that will be conducted in post-market, including general and
specific methods / procedures to conduct in relation to the product
covered by the scope of PMCF, also the aim of each activity described
and the rational for the appropriateness of the chosen general and
specific methods to achieve those objectives as well as the known
limitations of the planned activities such as for example incomplete
follow up, missing data and so on. The timelines of those activities
shall be also defined quarterly or at least yearly. Here are some
examples of different activities related to PMCF: 

A manufacturer device registry (specific for the type of device or the
group of the medical devices the product belongs to) can be indicated
together with a description and a summary of the plan. A
pre-specification of what quality and quantity data -- based on the risk
of the device(s) and the associated accessories -- to be collected and
analysed shall be included. Any possible evaluation of suitable national
public registries with clinical data on the manufacturer's own device
and/or on similar devices could be specified in this section,
identifying the expected quantity and quality of data to be gathered and
the search protocols to be adopted. PMCF studies planned could be
indicated in this section, together with a summary of the plan including
the design, sample size, the endpoints, the inclusion/exclusion criteria
(e.g. extended follow up of patients included in the pre-market clinical
investigations, new clinical investigations within the intended use,
retrospective studies). In case of implantable devices and class III
devices where clinical investigations have not been performed pursuant
to Article 61 (4), the PMCF plan shall include post market studies to
confirm the safety and performance of the device. Planned Real-world
evidence (RWE) analyses could be indicated in this section, together
with a summary of the plan including the design, sample size, the
endpoints, and analysis population. The real-world data (RWD) from which
these analyses are based on should be of sufficient quality and come
from reliable data sources. Surveys planned to collect information about
the use of the concerned medical device could be described.
Each activity will be developed in a different subsection (e.g. C.1,
C.2, ...), and for which the manufacturer will: 6 The expected lifetime

Define where the need of conducting the PMCF activity is coming from
(requested by notified body, clinical evaluation report, PMS, risk
management report, previous PMCF report, etc...) Provide the description
of activity, and if it is a general or specific procedure / method.
Define the aim of this activity: o confirming the safety of the medical
device o confirming the performance of the medical device o identifying
previously unknown side-effects (related to the procedures or to the
medical devices). o monitoring the identified side-effects and
contraindications o identifying and analysing emergent risks o ensuring
the continued acceptability of the benefit-risk ratio o identifying
possible systematic misuse or off-label use of the device

Describe the different procedures which will be used as part of PMCF: o
screening of scientific literature and other sources of clinical data o
post-market studies o collecting data in registries o survey from health
care professional o survey from patients/users o review of case reports
which may reveal misuse or off-label use

Describe the rationale for the appropriateness of the chosen
methods/procedures, including: o the justification for sample size,
timescales and endpoints o justification for comparator, on the basis of
intended purpose and state of the art o justification of the study
design on the basis of all of the above, and why it is sufficient to
ensure representative patient populations and provide for adequate
controls on sources of bias (an evaluation of the potential sources of
bias should form part of this) o a statistical justification for the
expected quality of outcomes, and justification for why this is
satisfactory in light of the residual risks. This is an important
consideration. For example, retrospective surveys with no justification
other than "this should demonstrate the expected quality of evidence
that we require," but without showing a statistical rationale, are not
acceptable.

Provide the timelines of the activity. A detailed and adequately
justified time schedule for PMCF activities, such as the analysis of
PMCF data and reporting, shall be described. 8

MDCG 2019-9 Rev.1
Introduction The Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices (1)
requires that the manufacturer shall draw up a summary of safety and
clinical performance (SSCP) for implantable devices and for class III
devices, other than custom-made or investigational devices. The SSCP
shall be validated by a notified body (NB) and made available to the
public via the European database on medical devices (Eudamed)1. The SSCP
is intended to provide public access to an updated summary of clinical
data2 and other information about the safety and clinical performance of
the medical device. The SSCP will be an important source of information
for intended users -- both healthcare professionals and if relevant for
patients. It is one of several means intended to fulfil the objectives
of the Medical Device Regulation (MDR) to enhance transparency and
provide adequate access to information3. The SSCP is not intended to: 
give general advice on the diagnosis or treatment of particular medical
conditions, nor  replace the instructions for use (IFU) as the main
document that will be provided to ensure the safe use of a particular
device, nor  replace the mandatory information on implant cards4 or in
any other mandatory documents. The main purpose of this document is to
provide guidance on the presentation, content and validation of the
SSCP. The word "shall" is used when there is a corresponding "shall" in
the MDR, otherwise "should" or "recommended" etc. is used indicating the
interpretation of the MDR. Abbreviations CIV ID CMR CS EU Eudamed FSCA

performance technical documentation13 Unique Device Identification -
device identifier14 Uniform Resource Locator (internet address)
General requirements and recommendations for the SSCP The information in
the SSCP should be sourced entirely from the technical documentation
(TD) of the device15. Examples of such documents are design
verification/validation reports, the risk management report/file, the
clinical evaluation report, and post-market surveillance (PMS) and
post-market clinical follow-up (PMCF) plans and reports. The IFU
includes information extracted from the same sources as the SSCP, but
may itself be used as a source for the SSCP if appropriate. The
manufacturer will assign to the SSCP an identifier (reference number)
that within the manufacturer's management system is unique to that SSCP
and will remain the same for the entire lifetime of the SSCP. In
combination with the manufacturer's SRN this will allow for the unique
identification of the SSCP in EUDAMED and in EU. The SSCP shall be kept
updated in Eudamed16. When the PMCF evaluation report17 and the periodic
safety update report (PSUR)18 are updated at least annually19, the SSCP
shall be reviewed and updated20 if needed to ensure that any clinical
and/or safety information in the SSCP remains correct and complete. When
updating the SSCP, all sections of the document shall be updated if
needed so that they are in alignment with the most current version of
the relevant parts of the TD of the device. This guide outlines the
minimum content of the SSCP. The manufacturer may add further
information from the TD of the device to enhance the comprehension of
the mandatory information providing: 8

it does not affect the readability of the SSCP and it excludes any
element of a promotional nature.
The SSCP shall be objective and adequately summarise both favourable and
unfavourable data21. For further guidance on the contents of the SSCP,
please refer to sections 1-8 of this document and to the template in the
Appendix. The format and structure of this template is recommended. It
addresses all of the SSCP content requirements of the MDR22, but the
order has been revised to enhance its presentation. The IFU shall
contain all that is needed to directly find the SSCP in Eudamed. The
following applies to the IFU23.  It shall state that the SSCP is
available in the European database on medical devices (Eudamed), where
it is linked to the Basic UDI-DI.  It should provide the URL to the
Eudamed public website: https://ec.europa.eu/tools/eudamed  It should
state the value of the Basic UDI-DI. Alternatively, another metadata can
be stated provided it can be used to unambiguously search and find the
intended SSCP in Eudamed. Translations to other EU languages No single
language will be understood by all intended users and patients in the EU
-- see the European Survey on Language Competences initiated by the
European Commission (4). In order to meet the requirement in the MDR
that the SSCP shall be written in a way that is clear to the intended
user and, if relevant, to the patient 24, the SSCP should be translated
into the languages accepted in the Member States where the device is
envisaged to be sold. This is by analogy with the requirement for an
IFU25. Note that Member States may have different language requirements
for an IFU depending on whether the information is intended for health
care professionals or for patients. The SSCP part intended for patients
should be provided in all the languages required for IFUs intended for
patients in the Member States concerned. If the selection of European
languages for the SSCP does not include English, then an English
translation of the document should also be provided. English is the most
common language used in medical scientific publications and is
understood by many healthcare professionals in the EU. Always providing
an English-language version of the SSCP further enhances access to
information26 about devices available on the EU market. There should be
one SSCP document for each language. Each SSCP document should state in
which language the SSCP was validated by the NB. The manufacturer should
ensure, through their quality management system, that the 21

translations are correct. Relevant SSCP information for patients The MDR
indicates that patients are also intended recipients of the information
in the SSCP, "if relevant"27. Devices for which information will be
especially relevant for patients include:  implantable devices for
which patients will be given implant cards28, and  class III devices
that are intended to be used directly by patients. For these devices, a
part of the SSCP specifically intended for patients should be provided.
Note: Devices listed in MDR Annex XVI, and eligible for a SSCP, should
always be considered as relevant for patient information. For devices
other than the two groups listed above, including any devices listed in
Annex XVI and eligible for a SSCP, the manufacturer may consider whether
it is relevant to provide specific information intended for patients.
This can be based on the manufacturer's analysis of the device in
question. Readability The SSCP should always have one part for intended
users/healthcare professionals, and when it is relevant (see above) a
second part for patients. Both should be clear and provide information
at an appropriate depth to reflect the healthcare professionals' and the
patients' different levels of knowledge29. For further guidance, see
references (5) and (6) in this guide. It should not be assumed that the
patient has any formal education in a medical discipline or any prior
knowledge of medical terminology or clinical research. It is recommended
that the readability of the part of the SSCP intended for patients is
assessed for example by a test given to lay persons. The manufacturer
may use a method it finds adequate for the readability test to confirm
that the SSCP is written in a way that is clear to the patient30.
Medical terminology, relevant for the medical device and the clinical
context, should be used consistently throughout the part of the SSCP
that is intended for healthcare professionals. Stylistic recommendations
The SSCP should be presented in an organised and unambiguous manner.
Usually, abbreviations and acronyms should not be used; if they are,
then in the text, the abbreviation or acronym should follow the full
phrase it is intended to replace. It may then be used thereafter
throughout the document.

Medical Device Medical Device Coordination Group Document
MDCG 2019-9 Rev.1
Medical terms should be explained in simple language in the parts
intended for patients. Consistency should be assured by giving the lay
term with a description first, and then the medical term immediately
afterwards (in brackets). On a case-bycase basis the lay or medical term
(but preferably the lay term) may then be used throughout the part
intended for patients. It is recommended to keep the information for
patients/lay persons and for intended users/healthcare professionals in
two separate parts of the SSCP, separated by a "page break". This
enhances their readability and facilitates printing of each part
separately. See the template in the Appendix of this document. The SSCP
should be written in a font type and size which allow easy reading.
Since the SSCP is intended for the public, it needs to be in a format
that everyone can read (and that is not editable) without the need for a
license. Therefore the SSCP file uploaded in Eudamed should be in PDF
format. When downloaded, the PDF file should be printable and searchable
with the search function in the program used to view the file, for
example the Adobe Reader. Validation and uploading of the SSCP
Validation of the initial SSCP by the NB When the NB has assessed that
all the required elements31 are included in the draft SSCP, accurately
presented and in alignment with the most current version of relevant
documents in the TD, the SSCP has been validated by the NB. In the
circumstance that the conformity assessment is performed according to
Annex X and XI in the MDR and there are two NBs involved, it is the NB
which assesses the TD according to Annex X that shall validate the SSCP.
The validation of the SSCP by the NB covers only one of the language(s)
accepted by the NB and agreed with the manufacturer. The manufacturer
should state in the revision history in each SSCP document in which
language the SSCP was validated by the NB. The timing of the SSCP
validation may depend on the class of device and the conformity
assessment routes:  For class III devices and class IIb implantable
devices, except sutures and staples etc.32, the validation is performed
when a draft SSCP as a part of the application documents is submitted to
the NB involved in the conformity assessment33, prior to issuing the
certificate.  For class IIa implantable and some IIb implantable
devices such as sutures and staples etc34, a draft SSCP as a part of the
application documents shall be submitted to the NB involved in the
conformity assessment. The draft SSCP shall be validated by the NB35. 31

Medical Device Medical Device Coordination Group Document
MDCG 2019-9 Rev.1
In the circumstance if more than one device is covered by the relevant
certificate, at least one draft SSCP shall be validated against relevant
documents in the TD during the initial conformity assessment, prior to
issuing the certificate. Draft SSCPs that are not validated at the
initial conformity assessment, shall be validated against relevant
documents in the TD at least once during the period of validity of the
certificate. Validation of updates of the SSCP between certification
activities The manufacturer has an obligation to keep the SSCP updated;
for further details see the section "General requirements and
recommendations for the SSCP" in this guide. Furthermore the
manufacturer shall prepare a periodic safety update report (PSUR) that
includes data gathered as a result of the post-market surveillance plan,
description of any preventive and corrective actions taken, conclusions
of the benefit-risk determination, and the main findings of the PMCF36.
If the PSUR contains information rendering any information in the SSCP
incorrect or incomplete, the SSCP shall be updated37 to be in line with
the information in the most recent PSUR. The manufacturer shall submit a
PSUR to the NB at least annually, or for class IIa implantable devices38
at least every two years39. If the SSCP has been updated with
new/changed information, except for strictly editorial modifications,
the manufacturer should submit the updated SSCP to the NB when
submitting the required PSUR.  If the SSCP has been previously
validated, the NB should validate the updated SSCP against the submitted
and evaluated PSUR. Both the NB and the manufacturer should make an
effort to keep the validation time short in order to meet the MDR
requirement of an update of the SSCP at least annually if indicated40. 
If the SSCP has not previously been validated41, the NB may defer the
validation until a validation against the relevant documents in the TD
is planned during the period of validity of the certificate. In
addition, as part of its surveillance activities, the NB shall verify
that the manufacturer has appropriately updated the SSCP. The NB should
take into consideration its assessment of the PMS plan and PSUR, the
PMCF plan and its evaluation report, and/or other relevant information.

Validation of SSCP at certificate renewal With each certificate renewal
application, the manufacturer should:  For class III devices and class
IIb implantable devices, other than sutures and staples etc.42, submit a
draft SSCP which has been updated within the previous 12 months,
regardless of whether there are new data or conclusions.  For class IIa
implantable and IIb implantable devices, such as sutures and staples
etc.43, confirm that the SSCP in Eudamed is in alignment with the
current version of the TD, or provide an updated SSCP where required. At
certificate renewal, the same principles should apply for the validation
of the SSCP documents as at the initial certification. Uploading of the
SSCP in Eudamed The SSCP shall be uploaded in Eudamed by the NB44, which
is the only actor that can manage the SSCPs in Eudamed. Timelines for
uploading of the SSCP documents in Eudamed:  The NB shall upload the
SSCP validated in conjunction with an initial conformity assessment at
the same time that it uploads the issued certificate.  For class IIa
implantable and IIb implantable devices, such as sutures and staples
etc.45, the NB shall upload the SSCPs of all the devices covered by the
issued certificate at the same time that it uploads the issued
certificate, even if some of the SSCPs have not been validated yet, and
are to be validated during the period of validity of the certificate.
The manufacturer should state in a revision history in the SSCP document
whether that revision was validated by the NB. It is important and
should be transparent to the public46 whether the SSCP document has been
validated yet by the NB. See the example of a revision history in
section 9 and in the template in the Appendix of this guide.  The NB
shall upload a SSCP whenever it has been validated against relevant
documents in the TD, and thus replacing the SSCP uploaded at the initial
certification with the currently validated revision.  The manufacturer
is responsible for the translations of the SSCP into other languages47,
once the "master" SSCP has been uploaded by the NB. If the "master" SSCP
is in a language other than English, then an English translation should
be provided by the manufacturer within 90 days of the upload of the
"master" SSCP. The NB should upload the English translation within 15
days of receiving this from the manufacturer.  The manufacturer decides
when it translates the initial "master" SSCP into other languages in the
Member States depending on when/if they plan to place the product on
that market. The NB does not validate the translated SSCP documents. It
should upload them in Eudamed within 15 days of receiving them. 42

The manufacturer shall verify that the SSCP, and any translations needed
for any single Member State, have been uploaded in Eudamed before
placing a device on that market48. 

When receiving an updated SSCP document in conjunction with the PSUR,
the NB should upload the updated SSCP document within 15 days after it
is validated, or within 15 days after deeming the validation to be
deferred49 until a validation against the relevant documents in the TD
is planned during the period of validity of the certificate. At
certificate renewal, the NB shall upload any updated SSCPs of all the
devices covered by the reissued certificate at the same time that it
uploads the reissued certificate. The NB should ensure the revision
history indicates whether or not these have been validated by the NB.
The manufacturer should provide updated translations to the NB within 90
days of the upload of the updated "master" SSCP. The NB should upload
these translations within 15 days of receiving them from the
manufacturer.

The intended purpose of the device and any indications,
contraindications and target populations 2.1. The device's intended
purpose(s) shall be described. 2.2. The indications shall be described.
This includes the stages and/or severities of the pathologies, the
specific medical conditions, and the specific anatomical locations or
confirmation that no anatomical locations are contraindicated, as
applicable. The target population(s) shall be specified, for example if
the device is intended for adults and/or children and/or
infants/neonates. 2.3. Any contraindications or restrictions for use or
limitations of the device shall be included. The information can be
sourced from the IFU, or from the clinical evaluation report.
3.
A description of the device, including a reference to previous
generation(s) or variants if such exist, and a description of the
differences, as well as, where relevant, a description of any
accessories, other devices and products, which are intended to be used
in combination with the device 3.1. A description of the device shall be
presented, including its operating principles and mode(s) of action.
Design characteristics should be included, for example key functional
elements and any materials or substances in contact with the patient's
tissues. Include information on whether the device is for single use,
and its method of sterilisation. For absorbable implants the stability
retention profile, including time to loss of stability and the
absorption time, should be provided. A picture or drawing can be added
accompanied by text. Information about the constituents should be
provided, as required for the IFU53, if the device incorporates  a
medicinal substance (including a human blood or plasma derivative), or 
tissue(s) or cells of human or animal origin, or their derivatives, or 
substances or combinations of substances that are absorbed by or locally
dispersed in the human body, or  materials incorporated into the device
that contain or consist of CMR (carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to
reproduction) substances or endocrine-disrupting substances, or 
materials that could result in sensitisation or an allergic reaction by
the patient or user. In Eudamed, the SSCP is associated to one or
multiple Basic UDI-DI(s). All UDI-DIs/devices associated to this Basic
UDI-DI will be seen as having the
53
MDR, Annex I (23.2) (e) and (r), and (23.4) (s)
12(24)
Medical Device Medical Device Coordination Group Document
MDCG 2019-9 Rev.1
same SSCP (a UDI-DI/device must always be associated with one and only
one Basic UDI-DI). If the device is a system of several
components/devices, each device in the system should have a Basic UDI-DI
but also one Basic UDI-DI for the system. It is the Basic UDI-DI for the
system that is intended to be provided in section 1.4 in the template,
and that will be associated with the SSCP in Eudamed. The device system,
and any Basic UDI-DIs of included devices, should be described in
section 3.1. The device description in the SSCP shall therefore include
all the device(s)/device system associated with the same Basic UDI-DI.
The description of the device(s)/device system should be comprehensive
and can be presented in different ways to include, if such exist, any
configurations / combinations / different sizes / specification of any
soft-ware versions that can be related to safety and/or performance and
their release dates / etc. The description should also include any model
number or similar designation used to identify the device(s)/device
system. 3.2. A reference to previous generation(s) or variants shall be
provided, if such exist. This applies both to changes/variants of the
device itself (same Basic UDI-DI) and to previous generation(s) or
variants associated with other Basic UDI-DIs, if available. A
description of the differences shall be provided, highlighting the
reasons for the change; for example changes to the intended clinical
benefits, changes to reduce identified clinical risks, or changes for
manufacturing reasons etc. 3.3. If there are any accessories54 that are
not themselves devices, but are intended by the manufacturer to be used
in combination with the device, they shall be described or listed. The
list of accessories should include all those that are essential for the
safe and correct use of the device. 3.4. If there are any other devices
and products intended to be used in combination with the device, they
shall be described or listed. However, generic surgical equipment and/or
other generic devices do not need to be listed. In the part of the SSCP
that is intended for patients, section 3 may be limited to the device(s)
in question (Basic UDI-DI) including relevant and necessary accessories
from a patient's perspective; see suggested headings for section 3 in
the template in the Appendix. 4.
Information on any residual risks and any undesirable effects, warnings
and precautions 4.1. Residual risks and undesirable effects
54
MDR, Article 2 (2)
13(24)
Medical Device Medical Device Coordination Group Document
MDCG 2019-9 Rev.1
This section of the SSCP guide and template includes residual risks55,
other than those contraindications, limitations, warnings and
precautions that are included in sections 2.3 and 4.2. Description of
residual risks and undesirable effects Risk is defined in the MDR56 as
the combination of the probability of occurrence of harm and the
severity of that harm. Harm is defined in the standard ISO 14971:201257
as physical injury or damage to the health of people, or damage to
property or the environment. Thus the term 'risk' includes both clinical
and non-clinical harms. The term 'residual risk' is defined in the
standard ISO 14971:2012 58 as "risk remaining after risk control
measures have been taken". There is a requirement in the MDR that the
IFU shall contain information on any residual risks and any undesirable
side-effects59, i.e. no sort of residual risk or undesirable side-effect
related to the device is excluded from disclosure. The SSCP should
contain information on at least the same residual risks and undesirable
side-effects as included in the IFU. For the purpose of the SSCP, an
undesirable effect60 can be understood as any undesirable side-effect
related to the device and that is experienced by the patient and/or can
be diagnosed and/or measured in the patient. For the clarity of the
SSCP, undesirable side-effects can be annotated also in other terms as
appropriate, to present any undesirable side-effects related to the
device in question. There may be device-specific terminology for
describing side-effects and risks in device-specific ISO standards or
scientific literature that is important to use to allow comparison of
clinical data. For example, some events indicated in the MDR by the
terms 'adverse events'61, 'undesirable side-effects' or 'incidents'62,
may all be annotated as 'adverse events' in the scientific literature.
Any further discussion on risks can be included in the SSCP if needed
for clarity or comprehension. Quantitative data The definition of risk63
includes the probability of occurrence of harm. Therefore the
information in the SSCP on risks shall also include quantifications.
This information can be sourced from the clinical evaluation 55

report where an updated examination of qualitative and quantitative
aspects of clinical safety is available, with clear reference to the
determination of residual risks and side-effects64. It should also be
clarified in the SSCP whether quantitative data on sideeffects or
residual risks relate to clinical data that were obtained proactively,
for example from a structured prospective follow-up study of the device
itself, or if the expected frequencies65 come from a systematic review
of the scientific literature. It should be disclosed in the SSCP if data
from spontaneously reported incidents or serious incidents66 are used as
one of the sources for estimating quantitative data on side-effects or
residual risks, in which case significant under-reporting needs to be
considered. A relation to time should also be included when presenting
the quantitative data, for example during five or ten years of use from
implantation, or adverse events per 100 patient-years for implantable
devices with constant hazards, etc. The quantitative data and the
relation to time should always be presented together. To use tabulated
lists for the presentation of side-effects and residual risks with
quantitative data and a relation to time, may enhance the readability.
In the part of the SSCP that is intended for patients, residual risks
and sideeffects should be explained and quantified in a way that
patients and lay persons can understand. A statement should be included
about how potential risks have been controlled or managed, and also a
statement on what to do if the patient believes that he/she is
experiencing side-effects related to the device or its use. See the
example in the template in the Appendix. 4.2. All warnings and
precautions pertaining to the device should be presented. However
warnings and precautions solely related to for example
installation/preparation of a device or relating to special procedural
steps can be discussed on a general level in the SSCP if a link (URL) to
the IFU on the manufacturer's website is provided. Always include any
warnings, precautions or measures to be taken by the patient or a
healthcare professional with regard to reciprocal interference with
reasonably foreseeable external influences, medical examinations or
environmental conditions. If any particular clinical follow-up is
necessary and mentioned in the IFU, that information should also be
included in the SSCP. 4.3. Other relevant aspects of safety should be
described. If the device has been subject to any field safety corrective
action (FSCA including FSN), the date of

undertaken should also be included. 5.
The summary of clinical evaluation as referred to in Annex XIV, and
relevant information on post-market clinical follow-up This part of
section 5 relates to content intended for the user/healthcare
professional. This section is intended to summarise, in a comprehensive
manner, the clinical evaluation results and the clinical data67 forming
the clinical evidence68 for the confirmation of conformity with relevant
general safety and performance requirements69, the evaluation of
undesirable side-effects and the acceptability of the benefit-risk
ratio70. It shall be an objective and balanced summary of the clinical
evaluation71 results of all the available clinical data related to the
device in question, whether favourable, unfavourable, and/or
inconclusive. See suggested headings for this section in the Appendix of
this document. 5.1. The SSCP should include a statement if conformity of
the device was assessed and endorsed by the NB on the basis of
equivalence. If equivalence was used, then the device(s) for which
equivalence has been demonstrated should be identified by name and Basic
UDI-DI if available, together with the name(s) of its/their
manufacturer(s). The SSCP should also include a statement whether the
equivalent device's SSCP is available in Eudamed. If not available in
Eudamed, the SSCP should include a summary of the clinical data
pertaining to the equivalent device, written in accordance with the
recommendations of this section 5, with a clear note that it relates to
the equivalent device. It should be evident from the summary what the
clinical evidence for the equivalent device was based on: whether it was
clinical investigations of that device itself, or if any other data were
used and then the sources of that data. Also include a summary of how
long-term safety and performance of the equivalent device has been
confirmed. 5.2. All clinical investigations of the device in question,
conducted before the CEmarking, should be summarised. It is recommended
to keep the format clear by grouping the information for each study. The
summary of each investigation should include the following non-exclusive

Adjustments all over the document to align it to Regulation (EU)
2023/607 and guidance MDCG 2022-2
1 Introduction Article 120(3) of the Medical Device Regulation (EU)
2017/745 (MDR), last amended by Regulation (EU) 2023/607, states that
devices which continue to comply with the AIMDD or MDD may be placed on
the market or put into service until 31 December 20271 or 31 December
20282, as applicable, provided the conditions set out in Article 120(3c)
MDR are fulfilled. These devices are called 'legacy devices' and in line
with MDCG Guidance Document 2021-253, 'legacy devices' should be
understood as devices, which, in accordance with the MDR's transitional
provisions, are placed on the market after the MDR's date of application
(i.e. 26 May 2021) if certain conditions are fulfilled. Those devices
can be:  devices which are class I devices under Directive 93/42/EEC
(MDD), for which an EC declaration of conformity was drawn up prior to
26 May 2021 and for which the conformity assessment procedure under the
MDR requires the involvement of a notified body;
 devices covered by a valid EC certificate issued in accordance with
Directive 90/385/EEC (AIMDD) or the MDD prior to 26 May 2021.4 The
conditions are set out in Article 120(3c) MDR and include, among others,
that legacy devices must continue to comply with the AIMDD/MDD5, as
applicable, and that there are no significant changes in the design or
intended purpose of the device6. Therefore, it is important for
manufacturers and notified bodies to have a clear understanding as to
what changes to design or intended purpose would be considered
'significant'.

except sutures, staples, dental fillings, dental braces,
tooth crowns, screws, wedges, plates, wires, pins, clips and connectors.

Regulation (EU) 2017/745 - application of MDR requirements to 'legacy
devices' and to devices placed on the market prior to 26 May 2021 in

5 See Article 120(3c), point (a) MDR; according to Article 120(3d) MDR,
the requirements relating to post-market surveillance, market
surveillance, vigilance, registration of economic operators and of
devices shall apply to the devices and replace the corresponding
requirements of the Directives. 6 See Article 120(3c), point (b) MDR.

MDCG 2020-3 Rev.1
It is essential for legacy devices that their certificates remain valid7
following changes that are not significant with regard to design or
intended purpose and that the required appropriate surveillance is
carried out8. The first revision of this guidance document MDCG 2020-3
on significant changes regarding the transitional provisions under
Article 120(3) MDR takes into account the experience gained with the
application of the original version so far, is aligned with the
equivalent guidance for IVDs, MDCG 2022-6 of May 20229 and adjusted to
Regulation (EU) 2023/607.
2 Scope This guidance document is intended to provide clarification on
the concept of 'significant changes in the design and intended purpose'
under Article 120(3c), point (b) MDR. It concerns manufacturers of
legacy devices. This guidance document does not elaborate on the process
for manufacturers' submission and notified bodies' assessment of changes
to the approved design10 or substantial changes to the approved quality
system or the product-range covered.11
3 Changes to Directive certificates It is important to highlight that no
issuing of new AIMDD/MDD certificates is allowed under Article 120(3c),
point (b) MDR12 (see also section 4.1). In particular, if the
manufacturer wishes to make a 'significant change in design or intended
purpose' within the meaning of Article 120(3c), point
7 See Article 120(2) MDR. This does not exclude the possibility that
during the transition period an EC certificate for
the manufacturer's approved quality system issued in accordance with
Annex 2/II or Annex 5/V AIMDD/MDD or Annex VI MDD, which has become
invalid, is replaced by a EU QMS certificate issued in accordance with
Annex IX, chapter 1, MDR, provided that the EC design examination
certificate issued under Annex 2/II, section 4, AIMDD/MDD or EC
type-examination certificate issued under Annex 3/III AIMDD/MDD remains
valid. 8 See Article 120(3e) MDR and MDCG 2022-4 Guidance on appropriate
surveillance regarding the transitional provisions under Article 120 of
the MDR with regard to devices covered by certificates according to the
MDD or the AIMDD.

MDCG 2022-6 Guidance on significant changes regarding the transitional
provision under Article 110(3) of the IVDR.
https://health.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2022-05/mdcg_2022-6.pdf 10 See
Annex 2, Sect. 4.4. AIMDD and Annex II, Sect. 4.4. MDD: "The applicant
shall inform the notified body ... of any modification/such changes
made to the approved design"; Annex 3, Sect. 6. AIMDD and Annex III,
Sect. 6. MDD: "The applicant shall inform the notified body ... of any
modification/significant change made to the approved product". 11 See
Annex 2, Sect. 3.4. AIMDD: "The manufacturer shall inform the notified
body which has approved the quality system of any plan to alter that
system"; Annex II, Sect. 3.4. MDD: "The manufacturer must inform the
notified body which approved the quality system of any plan for
substantial changes to the quality system or the product-range covered";
Annex V, Sect. 3.4. MDD: "The manufacturer must inform the notified body
which approved the quality system of any plan for substantial changes to
the quality system". 12 This does not mean that notified bodies are not
allowed to e.g. suspend, re-insate, restrict or withdraw such
certificates. Such activities should be communicated as written
decisions/statements. Moreover, notified bodies should document
corrections or additions to existing certificates resulting from changes
that are not significant changes to design or intended purpose (e.g.
administrative changes).

MDCG 2020-3 Rev.1
(b) MDR, the implementation of such a change would prevent the
manufacturer from placing the device on the market under the AIMDD/MDD
in accordance with that provision.13
4 Assessment whether changes are 'significant changes in the design or
intended purpose' in accordance with Article 120(3c), point (b) MDR 4.1
General In order to benefit from the transition periods provided by
Article 120(3) MDR, legacy devices may not undergo any significant
change in the design or intended purpose after the date of application
of the MDR, i.e. 26 May 2021. A significant change in the design or
intended purpose consist of two cumulative elements: 
there is a change in the design or intended purpose, and

the change is significant.
That means that changes that do not concern the design or intended
purpose are out of scope of Article 120(3) MDR. Equally, changes that
concern the design or intended purpose only fall under Article 120(3)
MDR if they are considered 'significant'. Changes in order to comply
with other Union legislation are also out of scope even if they relate
to changes in the design, only if the risk/benefit ratio of the device
is not negatively affected. The manufacturer is responsible for
providing evidence and justification that a change does not affect the
design or intended purpose, or, in case the change affects design or
intended purpose of the device, that it is non-significant, which should
be assessed case-by-case. The outcome of the assessment should be
documented and made available to a competent authority when requested.
If a change is not a significant change in design or intended purpose,
the implementation of such a change is allowed during the transitional
period without the need for certification under the MDR. In such cases,
the manufacturer is required to comply with the documentation
requirements of the AIMDD/MDD, i.e. the updated technical documentation
must allow assessment of the conformity of the product with the
applicable requirements. Additional considerations for devices covered
by a certificate issued by a notified body In line with the agreed
arrangements for notification of changes between the manufacturer and
the notified body according to the AIMDD/MDD (e.g. contractual
relationships, approved

Should the manufacturer wish to place such a changed device on the
market, they may do so under the MDR.

MDCG 2020-3 Rev.1
procedures14), changes and their implementation are to be verified by
the notified body as part of the surveillance activities, or following a
manufacturer's submission for prior approval. The outcome of this
verification will determine whether a certificate in accordance with the
AIMDD/MDD remains valid according to Article 120 MDR. In case of doubt
as to whether a given change, which concerns the intended purpose or the
design is significant, manufacturers should ask their notified body. The
certificate should not be amended. However, the notified body that
issued the certificate in accordance with the AIMDD/MDD may confirm in
writing, after having reviewed the manufacturer's description of the
(proposed) change, that the implementation of the change does not
represent a significant change in design or intended purpose under
Article 120(3c), point (b) MDR and that the related AIMDD/MDD
certificate remains valid until the end of the transition period15. Such
written confirmation corrects or complements information on an existing
certificate but does not represent the issuance of a "supplemented
certificate", since this is prohibited as mentioned in Section 3. In
case of requests from authorities, the manufacturer should number such
letters16 received from the notified body and submit them together with
the certificate. Where the conformity assessment procedure under the
AIMDD/MDD for a given legacy device requires the quality management
system (QMS) of the manufacturer to be approved by a notified body, the
manufacturer must observe that the conditions for which the certificate
was granted are maintained. In any case, changes to the QMS continue to
be subject to the agreed notification procedure between manufacturer and
notified body.
4.2 Changes not concerning the design or intended purpose Changes
concerning the manufacturer's organisation (administrative changes) or
changes concerning the manufacturing process should generally not be
considered changes in the design or intended purpose within the meaning
of Article 120(3c), point (b) MDR, even if they need to be reflected in
the information to be supplied with the device (e.g. label or
instructions for use). This includes for example: 
changes of the manufacturer's name, address or legal form, including a
merger or acquisition involving the manufacturer17;

changes in relation to the authorised representative;
14
Those change notification procedures may need to be adjusted in
accordance with the principles outlined in this guidance. This should be
subject to notified body assessment within the surveillance activities
according to Article 120(3) MDR. 15 Provided that conditions set out in
Article 120(3c) MDR are met. 16 In case of class I devices (not
certified by a NB), manufacturers may also drawn up a statement listing
nonsignificant changes performed to the device. This statement could
accompany the Declaration of conformity previously issued. 17 This does
apply only in cases where the legal entity certified under the
directive(s) continues to exist. Not covered are situations where the
manufacturer certified under the directive(s) will transfer device(s)
covered by those directive certificate(s) to another manufacturer who
will place these device(s) on the market under the MDR.


relocation or addition of new manufacturing sites, including when it
affects subcontractors or suppliers;

changing the supplier of a material, substance18 or component, provided
the specifications of the new material, substance or component do not
change;

adding or replacing a new material number for logistic reasons without
changing the material;

new process validation as part of manufacturing improvements or scale-up
of manufacturing.
Changes of the QMS, such as changes in the monitoring and control of
production and operations environment, generally do not impact the
design or intended purpose either, provided that the conditions for
which the conformity assessment certification was granted are
maintained. In any case, changes continue to be subject to the agreed
notification procedure between manufacturer and notified body.
4.3 Changes in the design or intended purpose 4.3.1 Design and intended
purpose As legacy devices need to be in compliance with AIMDD/MDD, the
benchmark for determining their design and intended purpose, as well as
any possible change, should be the AIMDD/MDD respectively. While the
AIMDD/MDD do not define the "design" of a device, the "intended purpose"
means "the use for which the device is intended according to the data
supplied by the manufacturer on the labelling, in the instructions for
use and/or in promotional materials" (Article 1(2) letter (f) AIMDD and
Article 1(2) letter (g) MDD). 4.3.2 Significance of changes To
facilitate a harmonised judgement of the significance of a change, this
guidance document provides several flowcharts in the Annex. The
assessment of a proposed change using the main flowchart and any of the
applicable sub-charts is intended to assist manufacturers, notified
bodies and market surveillance authorities in deciding whether or not a
change of the design or intended purpose of the device is to be
considered significant under Article 120(3c), point (b) MDR. A change is
considered a non-significant change of design or intended purpose per
Article 120(3c) point (b) MDR if the answer to every question in a
sub-chart leads to "non-significant change" also when returning to the
main chart. On the contrary, if any sub-chart delivers the 18
Changes to a medicinal substance -- including a change in its
manufacturing process -- which has undergone medicinal consultation
should be notified to the medicines authority responsible for the

result "significant change", the change being assessed is a "significant
change in design or intended purpose" according to the Article 120(3c),
point (b) MDR. 4.3.2.1 General considerations As a rule, the following
changes in design and/or intended purpose should be regarded as
"nonsignificant": 
changes related to corrective actions19 assessed and accepted by the
competent authority of the Member State in which the manufacturer or its
authorised representative has its registered place of business (see also
Q&A 17 of the CAMD's FAQ -- MDR Transitional provisions20) regarding
design changes - the same approach should apply also to changes related
to the intended purpose;

correction of spelling mistakes or merely editorial changes of the
information to be supplied with the device (e.g. label or instructions
for use);

updates of the information to be supplied with the device (e.g. label,
instructions for use or implant card) if they are required by EU
legislation other than the MDR (e.g. CLP Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 on
classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures21
read in conjunction with Annex I, section 7.5 MDD), are mere
clarifications and do not adversely affect the devices' safety and
performance in relation to existing or new risks;

clarifications of intended purpose, population, clinical application in
the information to be supplied with the device in line with the original
certification.
4.3.2.2 Changes in the intended purpose -- Chart A Regarding changes of
the intended purpose the following principles should apply (see chart
A): Non-significant change:

'Corrective action' refers to corrective action as defined in Article
2(67) MDR, i.e. any "action taken to eliminate the cause of a potential
or actual non-conformity or undesirable situation". This includes 'field
safety corrective actions' (FSCA) as defined in Article 2(68) MDR.
'Competent authority' should generally be the authority of the Member
State in which the manufacturer or its authorised representative is
established. It can either be a competent authority for vigilance in
accordance with Article 87 MDR or a competent authority for market
surveillance in accordance with Article 93 MDR. The role of the
competent authority is to assess and determine the acceptability of the
(field safety) corrective action proposed by the manufacturer aimed at
preventing or reducing safety risks regardless of whether the (field
safety) corrective action describes a change of design or intended
purpose. The assessment and acceptance of a (field safety) corrective
action by a competent authority does not exempt the manufacturer from
submitting changes to the relevant notified body under the AIMDD/MDD nor
the notified body from assessing the change in line with the agreed
arrangements (see also sections 2 and 4.1 of this guidance). The
manufacturer is responsible for implementing the (field safety)
corrective action, including changes in the design or intended purpose,
if needed. 20 CAMD Transition Sub Group, FAQ -- MDR Transitional

Limitation of the intended purpose (see Q&A 17.3 of the CAMD's FAQ --
MDR Transitional provisions20), such as:  restriction or deletion of
certain indications;  restriction or deletion of certain applications,
e.g. anatomical site, delivery pathway or deployment method; 
restricting the target population.
Significant change: 
Extension of the intended purpose, such as:  additional or new
indications;  additional or new clinical conditions.

New user or patient population, such as:  additional or new target
population;  additional or new user (e.g. change from professional use
to layman use).

New way of clinical application, such as:  additional or new
applications (different stage or severity of disease);  additional or
new anatomical site;  new delivery pathway or deployment method.
When assessing whether the intended purpose is being changed, changes in
the label or instructions for use, as well as promotional materials,
that are linked to the use for which a device is intended (e.g.
limitations, warnings) should be considered. 4.3.2.3 Changes in the
design -- Charts B to E Changes concerning software, substances or
materials, or sterilisation also concern the design of the device.
Specific flowcharts (C, D, E) are intended to assist in assessing
whether changes in those areas should be considered significant changes
in the design. Regarding changes of the design the following principles
should apply (see chart B): Note: Change of a software shall be
primarily evaluated per chart C. However, there may be cases where a
major change of a software may be considered a change in built-in
control mechanism or device's operating principles and therefore are
evaluated according to chart B. Non-significant change: 
change of the design that does not alter:  the built-in control
mechanism,  the device's operating principle,  the change of the
source of energy, or  the alarms systems and

change in a material which serves solely as a processing aid which is
not available on the finally cleaned device and therefore considered a
manufacturing but not a design change;

addition of an antioxidant to the drug coating of a combination product
that reduces the degradation of the drug during production but does not
alter its pharmaceutical properties or release kinetics. Note: These
examples are valid only provided that the risk/benefit ratio of the

substance), or to the medicinal substance itself;

change from a material with a low toxicological or biological risk to a
material with a higher one;

new or changed substance or material that adversely affects the safety
or performance of the device and therefore negatively affects the
risk/benefit ratio of the device.
Changes related to sterilisation -- Chart E Regarding changes related to
the sterilisation method or related to the design or the packaging with
impact on the sterile condition of the device, the following principles
should apply (see chart E): Non-significant change: 
change of the sterilisation cycle parameters;

1 Purpose of medical device classification The classification of medical
devices in use by the EU medical device legislation is a risk-based
system taking into account the vulnerability of the human body and the
potential risks associated with the devices. This approach uses a set of
criteria that can be combined in various ways in order to determine
classification, e.g. duration of contact with the body, degree of
invasiveness, local vs. systemic effect, potential toxicity, the part of
the body affected by the use of the device and if the device depends on
a source of energy. The criteria can then be applied to a vast range of
different medical devices and technologies. These are referred to as the
'classification rules' and are set out in Annex VIII of Regulation (EU)
2017/745 on medical devices (MDR). They correspond, to a large extent,
to the classification rules established by the International Medical
Device Regulators Forum (IMDRF) in the guidance document
GHTF/SG1/N77:20121.
2 Practical relevance of classification The purpose of this chapter is
to provide a general overview on the impact of the classification of
medical devices on different aspects of the device compliance with the
legal requirements. The explanations provide some simplified concepts
and are not exhaustive. For details see the MDR and related additional
guidance2.
2.1 General requirements Irrespective of the class of the device, all
devices must comply with all relevant obligations of the MDR. However,
some requirements depend on the device classification. For example, the
devices must:  meet the general safety and performance requirements,
including the requirements regarding the information to be supplied by
the manufacturer (Annex I of the MDR);  be subject to the reporting
requirements under the medical device vigilance system;  be CE marked
(except custom-made devices and devices intended for clinical
investigation, in which case they should comply with the provisions of
respectively Art. 52.8 and Annex XIII or Articles 62 -- 80, 82 and Annex
XV);  be assigned a Unique Device Identifier (UDI) number and be
registered in the electronic system, in accordance with MDR Article 29;
 if the device is implantable, be supplied with an implant card and
information to the patient in accordance with Article 18.

Medical Devices Medical Device Coordination Group Document
MDCG 2021- 24
According to MDR Article 51 devices are divided into the following
classes I, IIa, IIb and III, taking into account the intended purpose of
the devices and their inherent risks. Classification is to be carried
out in accordance with Annex VIII to the MDR. In addition, and according
to Article 52(7)(a), (b) and (c), Class I devices can be further
subdivided into Is -- sterile condition, Im -- measuring function and Ir
-- reusable surgical. The technical documentation3 to be drawn up by the
manufacturer must include the risk class of the device and the
justification for the classification rule(s) applied in accordance with
Annex VIII of the MDR. Sections 2.2-2.6 give an overview of some
requirements that depend on the class of the device. For detailed and
exhaustive provisions on each topic, refer to the MDR, as well as to
dedicated guidance where available4. Annex XVI products should be
classified in accordance with the classification rules in Annex VIII of
the MDR and taking into account possible provisions within the relevant
implementing acts covering Annex XVI devices.
2.2 Conformity assessment Conformity assessment is the process
demonstrating whether the requirements of the MDR relating to a device
have been fulfilled. Demonstrating conformity is in the first instance
the responsibility of the manufacturer and for most devices classes the
conformity is then assessed by a notified body. The higher the class of
the device, the greater the involvement of a notified body in conformity
assessment. Annex I (general safety and performance requirements) and
Annexes II (technical documentation) and III (technical documentation on
post-market surveillance) apply to all devices regardless of class.
Further relevant conformity assessment procedures (laid down in Annexes
IX to XI) will depend on the class of the device. For some classes, the
manufacturer has a choice of more than one procedure. Conformity
assessment is described in MDR Article 52. Custom-made or
investigational devices falling into any class have their own
provisions: Annex XIII for custom-made devices and Article 82 for
investigational devices. For class III implantable custom-made devices,
the manufacturer also needs to apply either Chapter I of Annex IX or
Part A of Annex XI.
2.3 Clinical evaluation and investigation For any device regardless of
class, the manufacturer must ensure the general safety and performance
requirements are satisfied (MDR Article 5, MDR Annex I). This includes
carrying out a clinical evaluation (MDR Article 5 (3), MDR Article 61,
MDR Annex XIV. For implantable devices and class III devices, a
premarket clinical investigation is compulsory, with some exceptions
such as modifications of an existing device, demonstrated equivalence to
CE-marked device, placed on the market under Directive 90/385/EEC or
Directive 93/42/EEC for which sufficient clinical data is already
available, and specific exemptions laid down in Article 61(6)(b). The
conditions for starting a clinical investigation vary 3 Annex II 1.1 (f)
MDR 4
https://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/medical-devices/new-regulations/guidance_en
5
Medical Devices Medical Device Coordination Group Document
MDCG 2021- 24
depending on the class of the device (see MDR Article 70(7) and Article
78). According to Article 61(10), if demonstration of conformity with
Annex I requirements based on clinical data is not deemed appropriate,
the manufacturer shall justify this in the technical documentation. For
class III implantable devices and class IIb active devices intended to
administer or remove a medicinal product, the notified body must also
follow the clinical evaluation consultation procedure where certain
documentation including the clinical evaluation report is submitted for
review by expert panels (MDR Article 54 and Section 5.1 of Annex IX). It
must notify the Member State competent authorities of the certificates
it has granted for these types of devices (MDR Article 55). The
manufacturer may consult an expert panel on their clinical development
strategy prior to performing the clinical evaluation and/or
investigation (MDR Article 61(2)). See also MDCG Guideline 2019-35 for
interpretation of Article 54. For implantable devices and class III
devices, other than custom-made or investigational devices, the
manufacturer must update the postmarket clinical follow-up evaluation
report as it will serve an input for the writing of the Periodic Safety
Update Report, and, if indicated, the summary of safety and clinical
performance6 (MDR Article 32).
2.4 Post-market surveillance The manufacturer must update the clinical
evaluation with clinically relevant information coming from post-market
surveillance, in particular the post-market clinical follow-up. For
class I devices, including sterile, those with a measuring function and
the reusable surgical instruments, the manufacturer must prepare and
maintain a post-market surveillance report (MDR Article 85), which must
be made available to the competent authorities on request. For class
IIa, IIb and III devices, the manufacturer must prepare a periodic
safety update report for each device, and, where relevant, for each
category or group of devices (MDR Article 86). This report must be
updated at least annually for class IIb and III devices and at least
every two years for class IIa devices.
2.5 Traceability For class III implantable devices, economic operators
and health institutions are obliged to have a record of the UDI of the
devices they have supplied or with which they have been supplied (MDR
Article 27). For class II and III devices, the economic operator is
obliged to provide information on the Member State(s) where the device
is, or is to be, made available when registering the device (Annex VI
Part A 2.4). In the case of implantable and class III devices, the
economic operator must provide the summary of safety and clinical
performance (Annex VI Part A 2.14). For single-use class I and IIa
devices packaged and labelled individually, the UDI carrier does not
have to appear on the packaging but must appear on a higher level of
packaging (Annex VI Part C 4.3). 5 6

MDCG 2021- 24
However, if the healthcare provider does not have access to the higher
level of packaging, the UDI carrier must appear on the individual device
packaging.
2.6 Instructions for use Generally, instructions for use must be
supplied together with the device. By way of exception, class I and IIa
devices may be supplied without instructions for use if such devices can
safely be used without the instructions and no other provisions of Annex
I Section 23 state otherwise.
3 How to carry out classification This section is aimed at presenting
definitions and terms useful for the application of the classification
principles and rules.
3.1 Basic terms and definitions Relevant definitions in respect to the
classification of devices are set out in Article 2 and Chapter I of
Annex VIII of the MDR but the Regulation also contains explanation of
further terms. These relevant terms and definitions for this guidance
are collected below.
Specific medical purpose The specific medical purpose is specified by
the manufacturer from those listed in the indents of Article 2(1) MDR.
Duration of use Transient Normally intended for continuous use for less
than 60 minutes. Short term Normally intended for continuous use for
between 60 minutes and 30 days. Long term Normally intended for
continuous use for more than 30 days.
7
Medical Devices Medical Device Coordination Group Document
MDCG 2021- 24
In certain instances the duration of use for a product needs to be
considered as the duration of effect. For instance, application of a
topical cream to the skin may only take seconds to apply but the cream
may remain in situ for many hours. The duration of use should therefore
not be considered as the time taken to apply the product but rather the
duration for which the product remains in or on the body.
Continuous use In calculating the duration referred to in Section 1 of
Chapter I of Annex VIII of MDR, continuous use means: '(a) The entire
duration of use of the same device without regard to temporary
interruption of use during a procedure or temporary removal for purposes
such as cleaning or disinfection of the device. Whether the interruption
of use or the removal is temporary shall be established in relation to
the duration of the use prior to and after the period when the use is
interrupted or the device removed; and (b) the accumulated use of a
device that is intended by the manufacturer to be replaced immediately
with another of the same type.' For example, a scalpel may be used on
the same patient throughout an operation that may last for several
hours. The uninterrupted use for an intended purpose, i.e. cutting
tissue, will normally not last for more than a few seconds at a time.
Therefore a scalpel is a transient use device. However, where usage of a
device is discontinued in order for the device to be replaced
immediately by the same or an identical device (e.g. replacement of a
ureteric catheter) this shall be considered an extension of the
continuous use of the device. As another example, the overnight period
when contact lenses are cleaned and disinfected is considered as a
discontinuation of the device use. For the determination of the duration
of use, only the specified time period of uninterrupted wear of the lens
(e.g. 16 hours) needs to be taken into account7. If it cannot be
demonstrated that components of the device are totally discontinued in
the interval between uses, this is also considered as an immediate
replacement and an extension of the continuous use of the device.
Invasiveness Invasive device Any device which, in whole or in part,
penetrates inside the body, either through a body orifice or through the
surface of the body. A device that administers energy to the body should
not be considered as invasive if only energy it emits penetrates the
body and not the device itself. Body orifice Any natural opening in the
body, as well as the external surface of the eyeball, or any permanent
artificial opening, such as a stoma.
7
MDR Annex VIII 3.6 8
Medical Devices Medical Device Coordination Group Document
MDCG 2021- 24
Injured skin or mucous membrane8 An area of skin or a mucous membrane
presenting a pathological change or change following disease, a wound or
a scar. Surgically invasive device9 An invasive device which penetrates
inside the body through the surface of the body, including through
mucous membranes of body orifices with the aid or in the context of a
surgical operation; and a device which produces penetration other than
through a body orifice. The term surgical operation used in this
definition includes all clinical interventional procedures in which a
device is placed into the body through the surface of the body. A
surgically invasive device always implies that it enters through an
artificially created opening. This can be a large opening, such as a
surgical incision, or it can be a pinprick opening made by a needle.
Therefore surgical gloves and needles used with syringes are surgically
invasive. In this context the following should be noted:  a surgically
created stoma used in urostomy, colostomy and ileostomy or permanent
tracheostomy is considered to be a body orifice; therefore devices
introduced into such a stoma are not surgically invasive.  in contrast,
a surgically created opening to allow access to the circulatory system
should not be considered to be a body orifice. Devices introduced into
such an opening are surgically invasive. The concept of surgically
invasive should be understood to cover also liquids that are in invasive
contact with organs, tissues or other parts of the body if the access
for such liquids is through a surgically created opening. For a device
that administers a substance, such a substance must be assessed in its
own right (e.g. substances administered by a jet injector). Reusable
surgical instrument10 An instrument intended for surgical use in
cutting, drilling, sawing, scratching, scraping, clamping, retracting,
clipping or similar procedures, without a connection to an active device
and which is intended by the manufacturer to be reused after appropriate
procedures such as cleaning, disinfection and sterilisation have been
carried out. Implantable device11 Any device, including those that are
partially or wholly absorbed, which is intended: --- to be totally
introduced into the human body, or --- to replace an epithelial surface
or the surface of the eye, by clinical intervention and which is
intended to remain in place after the procedure.

Medical Devices Medical Device Coordination Group Document
MDCG 2021- 24
Any device intended to be partially introduced into the human body by
clinical intervention and intended to remain in place after the
procedure for at least 30 days shall also be deemed to be an implantable
device. A 'procedure' must be understood in this context to include the
surgical procedure during which the implant is placed into the body and
the immediate post-operative care that is associated with the procedure.
The 'procedure' does not extend to the conclusion of the therapeutic
treatment, e.g. the removal of an implant must be considered to be
another 'procedure'. Thus a plate used to fix a fractured bone and which
remains in place after the procedure for at least 30 days is an implant
even if it is taken out after the fracture has healed. In this case the
placing of the plate and its explantation are two different surgical
procedures. Sometimes partially implanted devices are deemed to be
implants. For instance, if an operation is carried out specifically to
place an infusion port into the body which would remain in place for at
least 30 days after the procedure, such an infusion port would be an
implant. However, a non-tunnelled central venous catheter which is
intended for use for temporary vascular access and intended to be
removed after 7 -- 10 days is not an implantable device. Nor would a
suture used for skin wound closure that is intended to be taken out
prior to 30 days be considered an implant. Critical anatomical locations
For the purposes of the MDR, 'Central circulatory system'12 means the
following blood vessels: arteriae pulmonales, aorta ascendens, arcus
aortae, aorta descendens to the bifurcatio aortae, arteriae coronariae,
arteria carotis communis, arteria carotis externa, arteria carotis
interna, arteriae cerebrales, truncus brachiocephalicus, venae cordis,
venae pulmonales, vena cava superior and vena cava inferior. For the
purposes of the MDR, 'Central nervous system'13 means the brain,
meninges and spinal cord.
Active medical devices Active device means any device, the operation of
which depends on a source of energy other than that generated by the
human body for that purpose, or by gravity, and which acts by changing
the density of or converting that energy. Devices intended to transmit
energy, substances or other elements between an active device and the
patient, without any significant change, shall not be deemed to be
active devices14. The concept act by converting energy includes
conversion of energy in the device and/or conversion at the interface
between the device and the tissues or in the tissues. Electrodes
intended for E.C.G. or E.E.G are normally not considered active devices
because they do not normally act by conversion of energy.

MDR Annex VIII 2.6
13 MDR Annex VIII 2.7 14 MDR Article 2 (4)
10
Medical Devices Medical Device Coordination Group Document
MDCG 2021- 24
The application of energy from the human body for the purpose of
operating a device does not make the device 'active' unless that energy
is stored within the device for subsequent release. For instance, energy
generated by human muscle and applied to the plunger of a syringe (thus
causing a substance to be delivered to a patient) does not make this
syringe an active device. However, if a drug delivery system depends
upon manual winding to preload a spring which is subsequently released
to deliver a substance, then the device incorporating the spring is an
active device. Another example of an active device are elastomeric
pumps, where the energy from the human body is stored in the stretched
elastomer layer. Medical devices using prestored gases and/or vacuum as
a power source are regarded as active devices, as long as they fulfil
both the criteria under the definition e.g. gas mixers with anaesthesia
machines, aerosol pain relief sprays with a pre-stored propellant gas
supply and gas-powered suction pumps. Heating/cooling pads intended only
to release stored thermal energy are not active devices because they do
not act by conversion of energy. However, heating/cooling pads which act
by chemical action (e.g. exothermic or endothermic reaction) are active
devices as they are converting chemical energy into heat and/or vice
versa. The concept of significant change for energy includes changes in
the nature, level and density of energy (see Rule 9). This means that
for instance an electrode is not considered an active device under this
classification system as long as the energy input is intended to be the
same as the energy output. Resistance in a wire that causes minor
changes between input and output cannot be considered to constitute
'significant change'. However, electrodes used in electrosurgery for
cutting tissues or cauterisation are active devices because their
operation depends on energy provided by a generator and their action is
achieved by conversion of energy at the interface between the device and
the tissue or in the tissue. Software is also an active device13.
Software should be reviewed not only in the context of Rule 1115. Active
therapeutic device means any active device used, whether alone or in
combination with other devices, to support, modify, replace or restore
biological functions or structures with a view to treatment or
alleviation of an illness, injury or disability. 16 Active device
intended for diagnosis and monitoring means any active device used,
whether alone or in combination with other devices, to supply
information for detecting, diagnosing, monitoring or treating
physiological conditions, states of health, illnesses or congenital
deformities17. A device is considered to allow direct diagnosis when it
provides the diagnosis of the disease or condition in question itself or
when it provides decisive information for the diagnosis18.

Medical Devices Medical Device Coordination Group Document
MDCG 2021- 24
Devices with a measuring function The following criteria, if fulfilled
together, indicate that a device has a measuring function: a) The device
is intended by the manufacturer to measure: - quantitatively a
physiological or anatomical parameter, or - a quantity or a quantifiable
characteristic of energy or of substances (including medicinal products)
delivered to or removed from the human body. Spoons or plastic syringes
co-packed with medicinal products and used to measure a quantity of that
medicinal product to be administered to the patient are in this
category. Devices for the delivery of liquid to the human body without
graduation or scale (e.g. medicine spoons, cups, droppers without
graduation or scale or display of measuring unit) are not in this
category19. b) The result of the measurement: - is displayed in legal
units or other acceptable units within the meaning of Directive
80/181/ECC20, or - is compared to at least one point of reference
indicated in legal units or other acceptable units in compliance with
the mentioned directive.. c) The intended purpose implies accuracy,
claimed explicitly or implicitly, where a non-compliance with the
implied accuracy could result in a significant adverse effect on the
patient's health and safety. The expression 'claimed implicitly' covers
cases where the user, on the basis of the designation of the device or
of its accompanying documents, or on the basis of the common use, is
entitled to expect accuracy where the accuracy of the measurement has an
impact on the diagnosis or therapy of the patient. Measuring activities
during the manufacturing process including those for calibration
purposes are not covered and do not imply a measuring function of the
manufactured device.
Systems and procedure packs System and procedure packs is described in
MDR Article 22. They can combine medical devices, in vitro diagnostic
medical devices, and other products which are in conformity with
legislation that applies to those products, only where they are used
within a medical procedure or their presence in the system or procedure
pack is otherwise justified. In this case of demonstrated legal
conformity of each component, the systems or procedure packs no not need
to bear themselves an additional CE marking but they must bear the name,
registered trade name or registered trade mark of the person who
combines the products as well as the address at which that person can be
contacted.
19 N.B. they are qualified as devices. 20 Council Directive 80/181/EEC
of 20 December 1979 on the approximation of the laws of the Member
States relating to units of measurement and on the
repeal of Directive 71/354/EEC (OJ L 39, 15.2.1980, p. 40 ). 12
Medical Devices Medical Device Coordination Group Document
MDCG 2021- 24
A procedure pack means a combination of products packaged together and
placed on the market with the purpose of being used for a specific
medical purpose21. A system means a combination of products, either
packaged together or not, which are intended to be interconnected or
combined to achieve a specific medical purpose22. Where the system or
procedure pack incorporates devices which do not bear the CE marking or
where the chosen combination of devices is not compatible in view of
their original intended purpose, or where the sterilisation has not been
carried out in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions the
system or procedure pack shall be treated as a device in its own right
and shall be subject to the relevant conformity assessment procedure
pursuant to MDR Article 52. The classification is determined by the
intended use of the system or procedure pack. The natural or legal
person that combines the devices must assume the obligations incumbent
on manufacturers. For such combinations, including different devices,
the classification is normally determined by the intended use. In those
cases where the intended use of the final device is not specific enough
to determine the classification, the classification of the device is at
the level of the highest classified device included, taking into account
the new intended use of the device.
Other terms This section gives notes on other terms used in Annex VIII
of the MDR: Systemic absorption: The process by which substances or
their metabolites enter the body (e.g. by crossing mucous membranes) and
are distributed into the body via the blood and/or lymphatic system.
Wholly or mainly absorbed: The term 'absorption' in the context of
implantable devices refers to the degradation of a material within the
body and the metabolic elimination of the resulting degradation products
from the body. It does not apply to those substances that are excreted
without modification from the body, e.g. insufflation gases for the
abdominal cavity or laparoscopic and endoscopic procedures. Local
dispersion: The condition by which substances remain in a specific site
without being distributed into the body via the blood and/or lymphatic
system. Medicine / medicinal product: According to the definition given
in Directive 2001/83/EC: '(a) Any substance or combination of substances
presented as having properties for treating or preventing disease in
human beings; or (b) Any substance or combination of substances which
may be used in or administered to human beings either with a view to
restoring, correcting or modifying physiological functions by exerting a
pharmacological, immunological or metabolic action, or to making a
medical diagnosis.'

A 'nanomaterial' means a natural, incidental or manufactured material
containing particles in an unbound state or as an aggregate or as an
agglomerate and where, for 50% or more of the particles in the number
size distribution, one or more external dimensions is in the size range
1-100 nm; Fullerenes, graphene flakes and single-wall carbon nanotubes
with one or more external dimensions below 1 nm shall also be deemed to
be nanomaterials according to MDR, Article 2(18). Related definitions on
'particle', 'agglomerate' and 'aggregate' are also included in the MDR
Article 2(19-21). The definitions on nanomaterial and the related terms
were taken from Commission Recommendation 2011/696/EU on the definition
of nanomaterials23. Guidance on terms and concepts used in the
definition can be found in a report from the European Commission's Joint
Research Centre.24 Derivative means a non-cellular substance extracted
from human or animal tissue or cells through a manufacturing process.
The final substance used for manufacturing of the device in this case
does not contain any cells or tissues.
3.2 Application of the classification rules Before applying the
classification rules, the manufacturer should first determine if the
product concerned, based on its specific medical purpose, falls in the
scope of the MDR as medical device, accessory for a medical device
(Article 2 MDR), medical device part or component for replacement
(Article 23(2) MDR) or as a device without an intended medical purpose
listed in Annex XVI. It is the intended and not the accidental use of
the device that determines the class of the device. For instance, a
suture organiser that is intended to keep suture threads used in open
heart surgery in the correct order should not be considered as an
invasive device if it is intended to be kept outside the patient.
Similarly, if a healthcare professional or others uses the device in a
manner not intended by the manufacturer, this does not change the class
of the device for the purpose of conformity assessment. However, if the
normal clinical use of the device changes in time with evolving clinical
practice such that the intended purpose and classification of the device
changes, this should be addressed by the manufacturer and the conformity
of the device assessed for the new intended purpose. It is the intended
purpose assigned by the manufacturer to the device that determines the
class of the device and not the class assigned to other similar
products. For instance, two sutures that have the same composition may
well have different intended purposes. In case several rules, or if,
within the same classification rule, several sub-rules, apply to the
same device based on the device intended purpose, the strictest rule and
sub-rule resulting in higher classification will apply. In terms of
further clarification of the classification rules, the elements listed
below should also be considered.

Medical Devices MDCG 2021- 24
Medical Device Coordination Group Document How to use the rules
The manufacturer must take into consideration all the rules in order to
establish the proper classification for its device. The strictest rule
and sub-rule resulting in the highest classification determines the
class25. It is quite conceivable for instance that one of the general
rules that is not specific to active devices nevertheless applies to
such a device. The intended purpose and all the device characteristics
must be taken into consideration. The characteristic or combination of
characteristics in accordance with the intended purpose of the device
that falls into the highest class determines the class for the device as
a whole. In addition to the classification rules set out in Annex VIII
of MDR, the manufacturers must also take account of any applicable legal
acts and consider guidance documents which may support the
classification of their device.
Practical example A simple wound drainage system has usually three
components that must be taken into consideration: the cannula, the
tubing and the collector unit. If the system is sold without a cannula,
then the classification of the cannula does not need to be taken into
account. It is assumed here that the system is used for short term
duration, i.e. that uninterrupted intended use is more than 60 minutes
and less than 30 days. It is furthermore assumed that the collected
liquids are not intended to be reinfused into the body nor reprocessed
for eventual reinfusion and that the device is not intended to be
connected to a powered suction system. Intended uses
Rule
Class
Surgically invasive cannula to reach a wound site in the pleural cavity
to drain the cavity

IIa
Non-invasive tubing to evacuate body liquids towards the collector.

I
Non-invasive collector to receive the body liquids.

The clear conclusion here is that the manufacturer would have a choice
of applying class IIa to the whole device or carrying out separate
conformity assessment procedures for the cannula on one hand and the
tubing and collector on the other hand.

3.3 Handling of interpretational problems It is recognised that although
the existing rules will adequately classify the vast majority of
existing devices, a small number of devices may be more difficult to
classify. As soon a notified body needs to be involved, any dispute
between the manufacturer and the notified body concerned, arising from
the application of Annex VIII, may be referred for a decision to the
competent authority of the Member State in which the manufacturer (or
its authorized representative) has its registered place of business. In
cases where the manufacturer has no registered place of business in the
Union and has not yet designated an authorised representative, the
matter shall be referred to the competent authority of the Member State
in which the authorised representative referred to in the last indent of
point (b) of the second paragraph of Section 2.2 of Annex IX has its
registered place of business. Where the notified body concerned is
established in a Member State other than that of the manufacturer, the
competent authority must adopt its decision after consultation with the
competent authority of the Member State that designated the notified
body. The competent authority of the Member State in which the
manufacturer has its registered place of business will notify the MDCG
and the Commission of its decision. The decision can be made available
upon request26. Outside this regulatory procedure, competent authorities
may refer on an ad hoc and voluntary basis complex classification cases
for discussion at the Borderline and Classification Working Group of the
MDCG. Agreement positions on classification reached by this Working
Group are published for reference in the Manual on Borderline and
Classification.

4.2 General explanation of rules/practical issues/examples The examples
provided do not imply that the products are a priori qualified as
devices. Classification rules apply after the qualification of the
device has been established.
Non-invasive devices Rule 1 - Devices that either do not come in direct
contact with the patient or contact intact skin1 only General
explanation of the rule This is a fall-back rule applying to all devices
that are not covered by a more specific rule. This is a rule that
applies in general to devices that come into contact only with intact
skin or that do not come in direct contact with the patient.
Class I
Rule 1 All non-invasive devices are classified as class I, unless one of
the rules set out hereinafter applies
Examples  Devices intended in general for external patient support
(e.g. hospital beds, patient hoists, walking aids, wheelchairs,
stretchers, dental patient chairs)  Body liquid collection devices
intended to be used in such a way that a return flow is unlikely (e.g.
to collect body wastes such as urine collection bottles, incontinence
pads or collectors used with wound drainage devices). They may be
connected to the patient by means of catheters and tubing  Devices used
to immobilise body parts and/or to apply force or compression on them
(e.g. non-sterile dressings used to aid the healing of a sprain, plaster
of Paris, cervical collars, gravity traction devices, compression
hosiery)  Corrective spectacle frames (i.e. glasses) and lenses in
frames  Stethoscopes  Eye occlusion plasters  Incision drapes 
Non-invasive conductive gels i.e. ultrasound gels2  Non-invasive
electrodes (electrodes for EEG or ECG)  Permanent magnets for removal
of ocular debris  Wheelchairs pushed by hand 26
Medical Devices MDCG 2021- 24
Medical Device Coordination Group Document Practical issues of
classification
Some non-invasive devices are indirectly in contact with the body and
can influence internal physiological processes by storing, channelling
or treating blood, other body liquids or liquids which are returned or
infused into the body or by generating energy that is delivered to the
body. These are handled by other rules because of the hazards inherent
in such indirect influence on the body. Note 1: Intact skin includes the
skin around an established stoma unless the skin is breached. Signs of
breached skin include, but not limited to, tears, erythema, oedema,
weeping and infection. The definition of intact skin must apply for the
continuous use of the device. Note 2: Ultrasound gels are not to be
absorbed or locally dispersed within the body at the site of action in
order to achieve their intended purpose.
Rule 2 - Channelling or storing for eventual administration General
explanation of the rule This rule applies to non-invasive devices
intended for channeling or storing blood, body liquids, cells or
tissues, liquids or gases for specific purposes. Invasive devices, other
than surgically invasive devices which are intended to administer
medicinal products by inhalation, fall under the Rule 20 These types of
devices should be considered separately from the non-contact devices of
Rule 1 because they may be indirectly invasive. They channel or store
substances that will eventually be administered to the body. Typically
these devices are used in transfusion, infusion, extracorporeal
circulation and delivery of anaesthetic gases and oxygen. In some cases
devices covered under this rule are very simple delivery devices that
rely on gravity. Class IIa
Rule 2 All non-invasive devices intended for channeling or storing
blood, body liquids, cells or tissues, liquids or gases for the purpose
of eventual infusion, administration or introduction into the body are
classified as class IIa: - if they may be connected1 to a class IIa,
class IIb or class III active device; or if they are intended for use
for channeling or storing blood or other body liquids or for storing
organs, parts of organs or body cells and tissues,
Examples  Devices intended to be used as channels in active drug
delivery systems, e.g. tubing intended for use with an infusion pump 
Devices used for channelling gases, e.g. antistatic tubing for
anaesthesia, anaesthesia breathing circuits  Syringes for infusion
pumps  Devices intended to channel blood (e.g. in transfusion,
extracorporeal circulation)  Devices intended for temporary storage and
transport of organs for transplantation (i.e. containers, bags) 27

Medical Device Coordination Group Document 
 
IIb
- except for blood bags; blood bags are classified as class IIb.

I
In all other cases, such devices are classified as class I


Devices intended for long term storage of biological substances and
tissues such as corneas, sperm, human embryos, etc. (i.e. containers,
bags) Fridges/freezers specifically intended for storing blood, tissues
etc. Tubings/blood lines for extracorporeal treatment (dialysis and
apheresis therapies) Blood bags without a substance which, if used
separately, can be considered to be a medicinal product Non-invasive
devices that provide a simple channelling function, with gravity
providing the force to transport the liquid, e.g. administration sets
for infusion Devices intended to be used for a temporary containment or
storage function, e.g. cups and spoons specifically intended for
administering medicines2 Empty syringes without needles
Practical issues of classification If a device, e.g. tubing, intended to
be used for a purpose that would require it to be connected to an active
device, such a device will be automatically in class IIa, unless the
manufacturer clearly states that it should not be connected to an active
device of class IIa or higher. Note 1: 'May be connected to an active
device' - such a connection is deemed to exist between a non-active
device and an active device where the non-active device forms a link in
the transfer of the substance between the patient and the active device
and the safety and performance of one of the devices is influenced by
the other device. For instance, this applies to tubing in an
extracorporeal circulation system which is downstream from a blood pump
and in the same blood flow circuit, but not directly connected to the
pump. Note 2: See also Chapter 3.1.6 regarding the possible measuring
function.

Rule 3 Devices that modify biological or chemical composition of human
tissues or cells, blood, other body liquids or other liquids intended
for implantation or administration into the body General explanation of
the rule These types of devices must be considered separately from the
non-contact devices of Rule 1 because they are indirectly invasive. They
modify substances that will eventually be administered into the body.
This rule covers mostly the more sophisticated elements of
extracorporeal circulation sets, dialysis systems and autotransfusion
systems as well as devices for extracorporeal treatment of body fluids
which may or may not be immediately reintroduced into the body,
including cases where the patient is not in a closed loop with the
device. This rule covers also substances in direct contact with human
cells, tissues or organs in vitro before their implantation or
administration, without substances derived from human or animal origin
such as human albumin. Class
IIb
Rule 3 All non-invasive devices intended for modifying the biological or
chemical composition of human tissues or cells, blood, other body
liquids or other liquids intended for implantation or administration
into the body are classified as class IIb,
IIa
unless the treatment for which the device is used consists of
filtration, centrifugation or exchanges of gas, heat, in which case they
are classified as class IIa
III
All non-invasive devices consisting of a substance or a mixture of
substances intended to be used in vitro in direct contact with human
cells, tissues or organs taken from the human body or used in vitro with
human embryos before their implantation or administration into the body
are classified as class III.
Examples  Devices intended to remove undesirable substances out of the
blood by exchange of solutes such as hemodialysers  Devices intended to
separate cells by physical means, e.g. gradient medium for sperm
separation  Haemodialysis concentrates  Device removing specific blood
cells (e.g. activated) by specific binding to a matrix  Particulate
filtration of blood in an extracorporeal circulation system. These are
used to remove particles from the blood  Centrifugation of blood to
prepare it for transfusion or autotransfusion excluding centrifuges for
manufacturing a medicinal product  Removal of carbon dioxide from the
blood and/or adding oxygen  Warming or cooling the blood in an
extracorporeal circulation system.  Substances or mixture of substances
for transport, perfusion, storage of organs intended for transplantation
that do not achieve the principal intended action by pharmacological,
immunological or metabolic means
29
Medical Devices MDCG 2021- 24
Medical Device Coordination Group Document  
IVF or ART products without principal pharmacological/metabolic action
(substances or mixture of substances) IVF cell media without human
albumin
Practical issues of classification These devices are normally used in
conjunction with an active medical device covered under Rule 9 or Rule
11. Filtration and centrifugation should be understood in the context of
this rule as being done exclusively through mechanical methods.
Rule 4 - Devices that come into contact with injured skin or mucous
membrane General explanation of the rule This rule applies to
non-invasive devices as well as invasive devices that come into contact
with injured skin or mucous membrane. This rule is intended to primarily
cover wound dressings independently of the depth of the skin wound or
mucosa wound. The conventional types of products, such as those used as
a mechanical barrier, are well understood and do not result in any great
hazard. There have also been rapid technological developments in this
area, with the emergence of new types of wound dressings for which new
types of claims are made, e.g. management of the microenvironment of a
wound to enhance its natural healing mechanism. More novel claims relate
to the mechanism of healing by secondary intent, such as influencing the
underlying mechanisms of granulation or epithelial formation or
preventing contraction of the wound. Some devices used on breached
dermis or breached mucosa may even have a lifesustaining or lifesaving
purpose, e.g. when there is full thickness destruction of the skin or
mucosa over a large area and/or systemic impact. Dressings incorporating
a substance which, if used separately, can be considered to be a
medicinal product and that has an action ancillary to that of the
dressing, fall within class III under Rule 14. Devices composed of other
substances which are absorbed by or locally dispersed in the human body
fall under Rule 21. Class
I
IIb
Rule 4 All non-invasive devices which come into contact with injured
skin or mucous membrane are classified as: - class I if they are
intended to be used as a mechanical barrier, for compression or for
absorption of exudates;
- class IIb if they are intended to be used principally for injuries to
skin which have breached the dermis or mucous membrane and can only heal
by secondary intent;
Examples  Wound dressings for skin or mucous, such as: absorbent pads,
island dressings, cotton wool, wound strips, adhesive bandages (sticking
plasters, band-aid) and gauze dressings which act as a barrier, maintain
wound position or absorb exudates from the wound  Ostomy bags Are
principally intended to be used with severe wounds: 30

- class IIa if they are principally intended to manage the
micro-environment of injured skin or mucous membrane; and

- class IIa in all other cases This rule applies also to the invasive

 
Dressings intended for ulcerated wounds having breached the dermis
Dressings intended for burns having breached the dermis Dressings for
severe decubitus wounds Dressings incorporating means of augmenting
tissue and providing a temporary skin substitute Hydrogel dressings for
wounds or injuries that have not breached the dermis or can only heal by
secondary intent Non-medicated impregnated gauze dressings Polymer film
dressings Dressings for nose bleeds (the purpose of the dressing is not
to manage micro-environment) are in class I according to this rule
Dental wound dressings not containing animal derived material
Practical issues of classification The classification of devices covered
by this rule depends on the use intended by the manufacturer's, e.g. a
polymeric film dressing would be in class IIa if the intended use is to
manage the micro-environment of the wound or in class I if its intended
use is limited to retaining an invasive cannula at the wound site.
Consequently, it is impossible to say a priori that a particular type of
dressing belongs to a given class without knowing its intended use as
defined by the manufacturer. However, a claim that the device is
interactive or active with respect to the wound healing process usually
implies that the device is at least class IIa. Most dressings that are
intended for a use that falls under class IIa or IIb also perform
functions that are in class I, e.g. that of a mechanical barrier. Such
devices are nevertheless classified according to their intended use in
the higher class. For such devices incorporating a substance which, if
used separately, can be considered to be medicinal product or a human
blood derivative, or animal tissues or derivatives rendered non-viable,
see Rule 14 or Rule 18 respectively. Explanation of special concepts
Breached dermis or mucosa: the wound exposes at least partly the
subcutaneous tissue. Secondary intent: the wound heals by first being
filled with granulation tissue; subsequently the epithelium grows back
over the granulation tissue and the wound contracts. In contrast,
primary intent implies that the edges of the wound are close enough or
pulled together, e.g. by suturing, to allow the wound to heal before
formation of granulation tissue. 31

MDCG 2021- 24
Invasive devices Rule 5 - Devices invasive with respect to body orifices
General explanation of the rule Invasiveness with respect to body
orifices must be considered separately from invasiveness that penetrates
through a cut in the body surface (surgical invasiveness). For short
term use, a further distinction must be made between invasiveness with
respect to the less vulnerable anterior parts of the ear, mouth and nose
and the other anatomical sites that can be accessed through natural body
orifices. A surgically created stoma, which, for example, allows the
evacuation of urine or faeces, is also to be considered a body orifice.
The devices covered by this rule tend to be diagnostic and therapeutic
instruments used in particular specialties (otorhinolaryngology,
ophthalmology, dentistry, proctology, urology and gynaecology). Class
I
Rule 5 All invasive devices with respect to body orifices, other than
surgically invasive devices, which are not intended for connection to an
active device or which are intended for connection to a class I active
device are classified as: class I if they are intended for transient
use;
IIa
- class IIa if they are intended for short-term use,
I
- except if they are used in the oral cavity as far as the pharynx, in
an ear canal up to the ear drum or in the nasal cavity, in which case
they are classified as class I; and
IIb
- class IIb if they are intended for long-term use.
IIa
- except if they are used in the oral cavity as far as the pharynx, in
an ear canal up to the ear drum or in the nasal cavity and are not
liable to be absorbed by the mucous membrane, in which case they are
classified as class IIa.
Examples  Handheld mirrors used in dentistry to aid in dental diagnosis
and surgery  Dental impression materials  Stomach tubes  Impression
trays  Examination gloves  Urinary catheters intended for transient
use  Embryo transfer catheter and insemination catheter  Short term
corrective contact lenses  Tracheal tubes  Indwelling urinary

source in the visible spectrum
Practical issues of classification Regarding devices intended for
connection to an active device: the strictest rule and sub-rule
resulting in higher classification will apply. For instance a trachea
cannula for long-term use need to be classified as class IIb. Devices
composed of substances which are absorbed by or locally dispersed in the
human body may also fall under Rule 21
Rule 6 - Surgically invasive devices intended for transient use (<60
min) General explanation of the rule This rule primarily covers three
major groups of devices: devices that are used to create a conduit
through the skin (e.g. needles, cannulae), surgical instruments (e.g.
scalpels, saws) and various types of catheters, suckers, etc. Class

Practical issues of classification/Explanation of special concepts Note
1: Terms such as 'surgically invasive device', 'central circulatory
system', 'central nervous system' and 'reusable surgical instruments'
are defined in Section 2 of Annex VIII to the MDR. In particular
surgical instruments connected to an active device are not considered to
be 'reusable surgical instruments'. Note 2: The expression 'correct a
defect' does not cover auxiliary devices that are used in heart surgery
procedures, e.g. clamps, aortic punch instruments. The first indent of
this rule does not apply to aortic punches and similar cutting
instruments which perform a function similar to that of a scalpel. Note
3: 'Dedicated' means that the intended purpose of the device or
accessory is to specifically control, diagnose, monitor or correct a
defect of the heart or of the central circulatory system. Note 4: The
concept of 'potentially hazardous manner' is related to the
characteristics of the device and not to the competence of the user.
Rule 7 - Surgically invasive devices intended for short-term use (> 60
min <30 days) General explanation of the rule These are mostly devices
used in the context of surgery or post-operative care (e.g. clamps,
drains), infusion devices (e.g. cannulae, needles) and catheters of
various types. Class

prostheses to the maxillary or mandibular bones are in Class IIb
following the general rule. Note 4: The clause about chemical change
under this rule does not apply to products such as bone cements where
the chemical change takes place during the placement and does not
continue in long term. Note 5: Also non-implantable and non-active
accessories to AIMDs should be classified as Class III under Rule 8.
Active devices Rule 9 - Active therapeutic devices intended to
administer or exchange energy1, as well as active devices intended to
control/monitor/directly influence certain devices General explanation
of the rule This rule covers many different groups of devices, such
as: - electrical equipment used in surgery such as lasers and surgical
generators; - stimulation devices; - devices intended to emit ionizing
radiation 2 for therapeutic purposes, including devices which control or
monitor such devices, or which directly influence their performance; -
devices intended for controlling, monitoring or directly influencing the
performance of active implantable devices. Active implantable devices
are covered by Rule 8. Rule 22 may also apply to active therapeutic
devices27.

Practical issues of classification Note 1: The decision as to whether a
medical device administers or exchanges energy to and from the human
body in a potentially hazardous way should take into account the
following factors. The concept of 'potentially hazardous' is dependent
on the type of technology involved and the intended application of the
device to the patient and not on the measures adopted by the
manufacturer in view of good design management (e.g. use of technical
standards, risk analysis). For instance, all devices intended to emit
ionizing radiation, all lung ventilators and lithotriptors should be in
Class IIb. However, the manufacturer's obligation to comply with design
requirements and solutions adopted, exist independently from the
classification system. Devices for illumination, i.e. administration of
rays in visible light spectrum, for use in the process of diagnosis are
classified as class IIa or higher, e.g. visual electrophysiology or
fundoscopes for examination of the eye; whereas devices for illumination
for purposes other than in the process of diagnosis, e.g. therapeutic
purposes (light therapy), are class I. Note 2: 'Ionising radiation'
means energy transferred in the form of particles or electromagnetic
waves of a wavelength of 100 nanometres or less (a frequency of 3 × 1015
hertz or more) capable of producing ions directly or indirectly
(Directive 2013/59/EURATOM, Article 4, 46).

Rule 10 - Active devices for diagnosis and monitoring or intended for
diagnostic or therapeutic radiology General explanation of the rule This
rule covers a whole range equipment in various fields for capture of
physiological signals, as well as specifically therapeutic and
diagnostic radiology. Note that devices for recording diagnostic X-ray
images are covered by Rule 17. Devices specifically intended to monitor
active implantable devices fall under Rule 8 or Rule 9. Class IIa
Rule 10 Active devices intended for diagnosis and monitoring are
classified as class IIa: - if they are intended to supply energy which
will be absorbed by the human body,
I
except for devices intended to illuminate1 the patient's body, in the
visible spectrum, in which case they are classified as class I;
IIa
- if they are intended to image in vivo distribution of
radiopharmaceuticals; or
IIa
- if they are intended to allow direct diagnosis2 or monitoring of
vital physiological processes3,
IIb
unless they are specifically intended for monitoring of vital
physiological parameters3 and the nature of variations of those
parameters is such that it could result in immediate danger to the
patient, for instance variations in cardiac performance, respiration,
activity of the central nervous system, or they are intended for
diagnosis in clinical situations where the patient is in immediate
danger, in which cases they are classified as class IIb.
IIb
Active devices intended to emit ionizing radiation4 and intended for
diagnostic or therapeutic radiology5, including interventional radiology
devices5 and devices which control or monitor6 such devices, or which
directly influence their performance, are classified as class IIb.
Examples  Magnetic resonance equipment  Pulp testers  Evoked response
stimulators  Diagnostic ultrasound  Examination lamps  Surgical
microscopes intended to illuminate the patient's body in the visible

MDCG 2021- 24
Practical issues of classification / Explanation of special concepts
Note 1: 'Illuminate' means: to administer rays in visible light spectrum
to for use in the process of diagnosis for example in visual
electrophysiology and eye diseases, and not just to cast a light to
improve the visibility. When performing diagnosis to, for example,
perform visual electrophysiology in search of eye diseases, the intended
purpose of the device is not limited to 'illumination', but may include
diagnosis. Note 2: A device is considered to allow direct diagnosis when
it itself provides the diagnosis of the disease or condition in question
or when it provides decisive information for the diagnosis (MDR
2017/745, Annex VIII, 3.7). For the definition of diagnosis see the MDCG
Guidance document covering the borderline between medical devices and
medicinal products. Note 3: Vital physiological processes and parameters
include, for example, respiration, heart rate, cerebral functions, blood
gases, blood pressure and body temperature. Medical devices intended to
be used for continuous surveillance of vital physiological parameters in
anesthesia, intensive care or emergency care are in class IIb, whilst
medical devices intended to be used to obtain readings of vital
physiological signals as part of routine checkups or self-monitoring are
in class IIa. A thermal imaging device intended to monitor blood flow is
not considered to be a body temperature measuring device. Note 4:
'Ionising radiation' means energy transferred in the form of particles
or electromagnetic waves of a wavelength of 100 nanometers or less (a
frequency of 3 × 1015 hertz or more) capable of producing ions directly
or indirectly (Directive 2013/59/EURATOM, Article 4, 46). Note 5:
Therapeutic interventional radiology refers to diagnosis being carried
out during a surgical procedure. Note 6: This refers to active devices
for the control, monitoring or influencing the emission of ionizing
radiation and not to the subsequent processing, recording or viewing of
the resulting image. Devices for recording diagnostic X-ray images are
covered by Rule 17.
Rule 11 -- Software intended to provide information to inform decisions
with diagnosis or therapeutic purposes or software intended to monitor
physiological processes. General explanation of the rule Rule 11
describes and categorizes the risk of software based on the combination
of the significance of the information provided by the software to the
healthcare decision and the healthcare situation or patient's condition.
This rule also distinguishes between MDSW (medical device software)
intended to monitor vital and non-vital physiological processes (the
subrule only applies to software intended for monitoring purposes only).
43
Medical Devices Medical Device Coordination Group Document
MDCG 2021- 24
Software or equipment attached to devices which do not specifically
enable device(s) to be used in accordance with their intended purpose,
or to specifically or directly assist the medical functionality of the
device in terms of its/their intended purpose do not meet the definition
of an accessory. Software used in conjunction with medical devices(s)
which solely record, store or display information would generally not be
considered devices (see guidance MDCG 2019-11, section 3.3 for further
detail). For example, software analogous to diaries for recording
insulin doses would not be considered devices, unless an analysis is
performed on the data or the device in some way alters the patients
treatment, prescription, doses etc. Class IIa
Rule 11 Software intended to provide information which is used to take
decisions with diagnosis or therapeutic purposes is classified as class
IIa, except if such decisions have an impact that may cause:
III
--- death or an irreversible deterioration of a person's state of
health 1, in which case it is in class III; or
IIb
--- a serious deterioration of a person's state of health1 or a
surgical intervention, in which case it is classified as class IIb.
IIa
Software intended to monitor physiological processes is classified as
class IIa,
IIb
except if it is intended for monitoring of vital physiological
parameters 3, where the nature of variations of those parameters is such
that it could result in immediate danger to the patient, in which case
it is classified as class IIb.
I
All other software is classified as class I.
Examples  MDSW intended to rank therapeutic suggestions for a health
care professional based on patient history, imaging test results, and
patient characteristics, for example, MDSW that lists and ranks all
available chemotherapy options for BRCA-positive individuals. 
Cognitive therapy MDSW where a specialist determines the necessary
cognitive therapy based on the outcome provided by the MDSW.  MDSW
intended to perform diagnosis by means of image analysis for making
treatment decisions in patients with acute stroke.  A mobile app
intended to analyse a user's heartbeat, detect abnormalities and inform
a physician accordingly. MDSW intended for diagnosing depression based
on a score resulting from inputted data on patient symptoms (e.g.
anxiety, sleep patterns, stress etc.).  MDSW intended to monitor
physiological processes that are not considered to be vital.  Devices
intended to be used to obtain readings of vital physiological signals in
routine check-ups including monitoring at home.  Medical devices
including MDSW intended to be used for continuous surveillance of vital
physiological processes in anaesthesia, intensive care or emergency
care.  MDSW app intended to support conception by calculating the
user's fertility status based on a validated statistical algorithm. The
user inputs health data including basal body temperature 44
Medical Devices Medical Device Coordination Group Document
MDCG 2021- 24 (BBT) and menstruation days to track and predict
ovulation. The fertility status of the current day is reflected by one
of three indicator lights: red (fertile), green (infertile) or yellow
(learning phase/cycle fluctuation).
Practical issues of classification Note 1: The MDR contains several
references to 'serious deterioration of a person's state of health' and
to 'surgical intervention', notably in the vigilance or clinical
investigation context. Further horizontal guidance may be provided in
the future and will be available at:
https://ec.europa.eu/health/md_sector/new_regulations/guidance_en . Note
2: For the classification of software, it is needed to consider the
intended purpose, intended population (including e.g. diseases to be
treated and/or diagnosed), context of use (e.g. intensive care,
emergency care, home use) of the software and of the information
provided by the software as well as of the possible decisions to be
taken. Note 3 Medical device software should be classified in the same
way, regardless of the software's location or the type of
interconnection between the software and a (hardware) device. However,
in line with implementing rule 3.3 Annex VIII to the MDR, software which
drives a device or influences the use of a device shall fall within the
same class as the device. For further information on qualification and
classification of software consult: MDCG 2019-11 Qualification and

Special rules Rule 14 - Devices incorporating, as an integral part, an
ancillary medicinal product, and medicinal products derived from human
blood or blood plasma General explanation of the rule This rule covers
those devices incorporating, as an integral part, a substance which, if
used separately, can be considered to be a medicinal product, with an
action ancillary to that of the device. The principal intended action of
the device must not be achieved through a pharmacological, immunological
or metabolic action of the incorporated medicinal substance1. If the
principal intended action of the device is mainly achieved by the action
of the medicinal substance, the integral product shall be governed by
Directive 2001/83/EC or Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 of the European
Parliament and of the Council, as applicable. For more information see
the MDCG Guidance document covering the borderline between medical
devices and medicinal products. The same principle applies if a

Practical issues of classification Note 1: The definition of 'substance'
in Article 1 (3) of Directive 2001/83/EC is applicable as far as not
excluded by the MDR (e. g. exclusion criteria Article 1 (6) (h)). Note
2: IVF cell media with human albumin are in class III according to Rule
14 and Rule 3. (Rule 14 applies, being the strictest, according to MDR,
Annex VIII, chapter II, point 3.5.) Note 3: This only applies if the
effect of the medicinal substance is ancillary -- if it is the main
effect, the IUD would be classified as a medicinal product N.B.: For the
clarification of the meaning and application of 'a substance which, if
used separately, can be considered to be a medicinal product' and of
'has an action ancillary to that of the device', clarification which is
relevant for the application of this rule, see clarification provided in

procedures, each of which uses different technologies and techniques. It
covers non-active devices and active devices used to record X-ray
diagnostic images of the human body. The intention of the rule is to
cover primarily digital devices and analogous recording media, but not
media (including digital media) used for subsequent image processing and
storage. Class IIa
Rule 17 Devices specifically intended for recording of diagnostic images
generated by X-ray radiation are classified as class IIa.
Examples  Digital x-ray detectors for recording images 
Photostimulable phosphor plates  X-ray films
Practical issues of classification Note 1: Devices intended to emit
ionizing radiation for diagnostic and or therapeutic purposes are not
covered by this rule. See Rule 10.
Rule 18 - Devices manufactured utilizing tissue or cells of human or
animal origin or their derivatives General explanation of the rule This
rule covers devices manufactured utilizing tissues or cells of human or
animal origin, or their derivatives, which are non-viable or rendered
non-viable, i.e. where there is no longer any capacity for cellular
metabolic activity. This includes devices containing derivatives of
human origin that have an ancillary action to that of the device, as
well as devices that contain or are made of animal tissues
(non-derivative) that have been rendered non-viable, or their
derivatives.
Class III
Rule 18 All devices manufactured utilising tissues or cells of human or
animal origin, or their derivatives1, which are non- viable or rendered
non-viable, are classified as class III,
Examples  Animal derived biological heart valves  Porcine xenograft
dressings 50
Medical Devices MDCG 2021- 24
Medical Device Coordination Group Document   
I3
unless such devices are manufactured utilising tissues or cells of
animal origin, or their derivatives, which are non-viable or rendered
non-viable and are devices intended to come into contact with intact
skin only.
  
Devices made from animal sourced collagen/gelatine Devices utilising
hyaluronic acid of animal origin Substance-based devices containing
collagen for use in body orifices Collagen dermal fillers Bone graft
substitutes Leather components of orthopaedic appliances
Practical issues of classification Note 1: Derivatives are products that
are processed from animal tissues and excludes products made by animals
e.g. milk, silk, beeswax, honey, propolis, royal jelly, hair, lanolin.
Note 2: The industrial manufacturing process for some devices may employ
raw materials which contain small amounts of tallow or tallow
derivatives (e.g. stearates in polymers) for example for greasing the
moulds. Such substances, which may be present in the final device only
as trace amounts, are not considered as derivatives of animal tissues
for the purpose of this rule which therefore does not apply. However, if
such substances are a constituent part of a device the rule will apply,
for example wound dressings impregnated with tallow. Such an exemption
applies only to classification, and not to other obligations related to
devices manufactured utilising non-viable substances of animal origin,
such as those referred to in Annex I 13.2. Note 3: This rule does not
apply to devices manufactured utilizing tissues or cells of animal
origin or their derivatives coming into contact with intact skin only.
In such cases they are in class I in accordance to Rule 1. Intact skin
includes the skin around an established stoma unless the skin is
breached.
Rule 19 - Devices incorporating or consisting of nanomaterial29 General
explanation of the rule The concept of internal exposure is a key
element for the classification incorporating or consisting of
nanomaterials. In its 'Opinion on the Guidance on the Determination of
Potential Health Effects of Nanomaterials Used in Medical Devices'30,
the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks
(SCENIHR) states as a conclusion, that the potential risk from the use
of nanomaterials in medical devices is 29 2017/745/EC preamble, recital

mainly associated with the possibility for release of free nanoparticles
from the device and the duration of exposure. Table 3 of the SCENIHR
Opinion estimates both external and internal exposure based on the type
of device, type of application, type (location) of contact, and duration
of contact. As indicated in the explanation of table 3 of the SCENIHR
opinion, the 'potential internal systemic exposure of all organ systems'
is what is listed, which can be expected to occur after release of free
nanoparticles from invasive devices as well as from non-invasive devices
in contact with a breached or compromised body surface. This Table 3
uses the terms high/medium/low/negligible, as also used in the
classification rule. This Table 3 could be used as a starting point for
correct classification. This Table 3 indicates a value for potential
contact and/or external exposure to the nanomaterial and potential
internal systemic exposure of all organ systems However, every
individual device needs to be classified taking into account its own
specific characteristics with regard to the potential release of free
nanoparticles taking also into account the exposure by the same
nanomaterial via daily exposure routes., Also factors such as the number
of nanomaterials in or on the product and the amount of product applied
in the intended use have been taken into account. This Table 3 indicates
a value for potential contact and/or external exposure to the
nanomaterial and potential internal systemic exposure of all organ
systems. Class III
Rule19 All devices incorporating or consisting of nanomaterial are
classified as ---class III if they present a high1 or medium potential
for internal exposure2
Examples  
 IIb
--- class IIb if they present a low1 potential for internal exposure
 
IIa
--- class IIa if they present a negligible1 potential for internal
exposure
  
Bone fillers with nanomaterials in their formulation (not polymerized
before blood/tissue contact, and degradable) Superparamagnetic iron
oxide nanoparticles (Intended use: thermal ablation of tumors or thermal
modulation of the tumor microenvironment by submission to alternating
magnetic fields) Intravascular catheter made of non-degradable polymer,
with nano-coating31 Bone fixation screws/plates with a strongly bound
nano-coating high potential Solution administration set made of
non-degradable polymer, with a strongly bound nano-coating Intravascular
catheter for short term use made of nondegradable polymer, with
nanomaterial embedded in the polymer matrix Solution administration set
made of non-degradable polymer, with nanomaterial embedded in the
polymer matrix Dental filling materials
Practical issues of classification Note 1: The high, medium, low or
negligible potential of internal exposure is based on the combination of
different factors such as the application site of a medical device, type
of contact (e.g. tissue, cells or body fluids), contact time and the
type of incorporation of the nanomaterial(s) 31 Coating containing
nanomaterials
52
Medical Devices MDCG 2021- 24
Medical Device Coordination Group Document
(free, fixed, embedded). When the nanomaterial is applied as coating on
the surface of the device, it is important to consider the type of
interaction with the material (chemisorption versus physisorption). When
the nanomaterial is embedded in a matrix it will be important to
consider the degradability of the material. Note 2: Internal exposure:
exposure may occur via injured skin or mucous membrane, (surgically)
invasive devices and implantable devices. Note 3: Dental materials which
are placed in the patient's teeth in a paste form, where they are cured
to a solid form, may release nanomaterials during a very short exposure
time. For most of the exposure time, these devices contain firmly bound
nanomaterials. In many cases, grinding and/or polishing takes place
during the application of the device, and could also lead to exposure to
nanomaterials. Such nanomaterials do not necessarily contain the
original nanomaterials present in the paste formulation. It is very
important to include this aspect in the risk assessment of such devices.
For classification purposes the potential internal exposure to
nanomaterials from these devices can generally be considered negligible.
Classification of this kind of materials should be based on the first
state, in this example, the short exposure to the paste form which has
higher potential for release than the cured material. Note 4: Devices
with components incorporating nanomaterials that have no intended direct
or indirect contact with users or patients, such as the tires of
wheelchairs or walking frames made from rubber reinforced with carbon
black nanomaterials, should be exempt from classification under Rule 19.
Note 5: Medical devices not incorporating or consisting of nanomaterials
can still present a potential for internal exposure to nanomaterials due
to degradation or wear processes. While it is very important to include
this aspect in the risk assessment of such devices, it is not a factor
to be considered when deciding the classification under Rule 19 since
this rule is only applicable for medical devices incorporating or
consisting of nanomaterials.
Rule 20 - Invasive devices, intended to administer medicinal product by
inhalation General explanation of the rule This rule covers active and
non-active medical devices with a respiratory route of drug delivery. In
contrast to other rules covering devices that administer medicinal
products, Rule 20 is also specifically intended to cover medical devices
where the impact of the medical device on the efficacy and safety of the
administered medicinal product is critical. The rule also covers
drugdelivery products that are intended to treat life-threatening
conditions. Class IIa
Rule 20 All invasive devices with respect to body orifices, other than
surgically invasive devices, which are intended to administer medicinal
products by inhalation are classified as class IIa,
Examples  Spacer intended for metered dose inhalers (attached to the
inhaler) unless treating lifethreatening conditions. 53
Medical Devices MDCG 2021- 24
Medical Device Coordination Group Document   
IIb
unless their mode of action has an essential impact1 on the efficacy and
safety of the administered medicinal product or they are intended to
treat life- threatening conditions, in which case they are classified as
class IIb


Inhalers for nicotine replacement therapy (nicotine not included) Oxygen
delivery system with a nasal cannula unless treating life-threatening
conditions Inhalers and nebulisers in case their mode of action has
probably no essential impact on the efficacy and safety of the
administered medicinal product or which are not intended to treat
life-threatening conditions Nebulisers (not pre-charged with a specific
medicinal product) where the failure to deliver the appropriate dosage
characteristics could be hazardous Spacer intended for metered dose
inhalers attached to the inhaler.
Practical issues of classification Note 1. 'Essential impact' includes
drug delivery systems where the device has a significant impact on
factors that influence inhaled medicinal product deposition within the
airways including inhalation flow, aerosol velocity, the particle size
of the inhaled drug and the amount of drug reaching the patient.
Rule 21 Devices composed of substances that are introduced via a body
orifice or applied to the skin General explanation of the rule This rule
covers a wide range of exclusively substance-based medical devices. In
this context, 'substance' means any matter that is part of the medical
device, including those according to the definition of 'substance' in
Article 1(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. This is provided that they are not
excluded by the MDR (e.g. exclusion criteria in article 1 (6) (h)). The
specific medical purpose is specified by the manufacturer from those
listed in the indents of Article 2(1) MDR. Importantly, if the principal
intended action of such substance-based medical devices is achieved or
supported by pharmacological, immunological or metabolic means,
Directive 2001/83/EC or Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 or Rule 14 has to be
applied to the product, respectively. The classification takes into
account the site of application of the medical device as well as the
site where the medical device performs its action in or on the human
body. For the purpose of this rule nails are also considered as falling
under 'skin'. 54
Medical Devices MDCG 2021- 24
Medical Device Coordination Group Document
Manufacturers of substance-based devices should provide clear
information supporting the mode of action through which the substance
achieves the intended specific medical purpose as a basis for the
application of this rule, including the site of application as well as
the site where the action is achieved in or on the body. Class III
III IIa
Rule 21 Devices that are composed of substances or of combinations of
substances that are intended to be introduced into the human body via a
body orifice or applied to the skin and that are absorbed by or locally
dispersed in the human body are classified as: --- class III if they, or
their products of metabolism, are systemically absorbed by the human
body in order to achieve the intended purpose; --- class III if they
achieve their intended purpose in the stomach or lower gastrointestinal
tract and they, or their products of metabolism, are systemically
absorbed by the human body;
Examples
--- class IIa if they are applied to the skin or if they are applied in
the nasal or oral cavity as far as the pharynx1, and achieve their
intended purpose on those cavities; and

 
  IIb
--- class IIb in all other cases.
      
Na/Mg alginate, xyloglucan Fat absorbers that are systemically absorbed,
themselves or their metabolites Substance-based formulations for skin
treatment Salt water used e.g. as nose or throat sprays Oral cough
treatments achieving their intended purpose in the oral cavity as far as
the pharynx Simethicone preparations for oral administration Active coal
for oral administration Gel for vaginal moisturizing / vaginal
lubricants Eye drops for hydration Ear drops1, 2 Medical devices, for
oral administration, for the treatment of diarrhoea, e.g. kaolin,
diosmectite Medical devices, for oral administration, for the treatment
of obesity, e.g. fructooligosaccharides, glucomannan
Practical issues of classification Products acting in the nasal or oral
cavity may be to some extent be ingested or inhaled. These products will
be class IIa devices if the products achieve their intended purpose
solely in these cavities, and not in the respiratory tract, stomach or
lower gastrointestinal tract.

N.B.: examples provided do not imply that the products are a priori
qualified as devices. Classification rules apply after the qualification
of the device has been established. Note 1: There is a normal anatomical
connection, the Eustachian tube, from the middle ear to the nasopharynx.
If the Eustachian tube was to be accessed from the nasopharynx
direction, this would be considered beyond the pharynx, so this does not
fulfil the criteria of 'as far as the pharynx'. Note 2: In the majority
of cases the drops would only enter the ear as far as the ear drum. This
is regarded as applied to the skin. The outer layer of the tympanic
membrane is epithelium, so if there is an intact tympanic membrane, then
the drops are applied only to the skin and has its action locally, and
consequently the device would be class IIa. This will be the case unless
the ear drum (tympanic membrane) is perforated and the product is
intended to be used on perforated ear drums.
Rule 22 Active therapeutic devices, with an incorporated diagnostic
function General explanation of the rule This rule is intended for
therapeutic devices whose intended functionality is dependent to a
significant degree on an integrated or incorporated diagnostic function.
Automated or 'closed-loop' therapeutic systems are systems in which
relevant biological conditions are automatically monitored (uses
feedback from physiological sensors) and is used to adjust a therapy in
order to maintain or achieve a particular physiological state. Such
devices are normally used in precision medicine and/or personalised
therapies for obtaining optimal therapeutic efficacy. This rule covers
systems such as autonomic pharmacological (drug-delivery) and
neuromodulation systems. Class III
Rule 22 Active therapeutic devices with an integrated or incorporated
diagnostic function1 which significantly determines the patient
management by the device, such as closed loop systems or automated
external defibrillators, are classified as class III.
Examples  Automated external defibrillators (AED) including their
pads/electrodes  Semiautomatic external defibrillators  Automated
closed loop insulin delivery system  Automated external infusion pumps
with integrated sensors to adapt the infusion therapy  Devices in
brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) -- used for e.g. motor control in
severely paralyzed patients  Closed-loop systems for deep brain
stimulation (DBS) treatment of various neurological conditions 56
Medical Devices MDCG 2021- 24
Medical Device Coordination Group Document 
Closed-loop dynamic neurochemical control of therapeutic interventions
e.g. target-controlled anaesthesia / infusion systems
Practical issues of classification Note 1. 'Integrated or incorporated
diagnostic function' means the functionality of a system including a
physiological sensors e.g. the AED electrodes/pads using a feedback
control to process and record changes in the patient's physiological
state to continuously adjust a therapy. The diagnostic function can be
physically integrated or a component of an external sub-system.

MDCG 2023-3 Questions and Answers on vigilance terms and concepts as
outlined in the Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices
February 2023
This document has been endorsed by the Medical Device Coordination Group
(MDCG) established by Article 103 of Regulation (EU) 2017/745. The MDCG
is composed of representatives of all Member States and it is chaired by
a representative of the European Commission. The document is not a
European Commission document and it cannot be regarded as reflecting the
official position of the European Commission. Any views expressed in
this document are not legally binding and only the Court of Justice of
the European Union can give binding interpretations of Union law.

Introduction This document aims to clarify important terms and concepts
that are outlined in Section 2 of Chapter VII of the Regulation (EU)
2017/745 on medical devices (MDR). Establishing a common understanding
of these terms and concepts is necessary for an effective and harmonised
implementation of the vigilance requirements under the MDR. The document
is written for competent authorities, economic operators and other
relevant parties. Some of the definitions presented in this document are
reintroduced from the Guidelines on a Medical Devices Vigilance System1
with, where relevant, modifications for alignment with the MDR. The term
'devices' will be understood to include medical devices, accessories for
medical devices and products listed in Annex XVI to the MDR. The
document is non-exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the
MDR, relevant standards2 and MDCG guidance documents3. Terms and
concepts that are outlined in the corresponding articles of the
Regulation (EU) 2017/746 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices (IVDR)
are outside the scope of this document.4 1. What is the difference
between an 'incident' and a 'serious incident' with a device under the
MDR? The main difference between an 'incident' and a 'serious incident'
under the MDR is the severity of the related health or public health
outcome (or potential outcome) linked to an issue with a device made
available on the market. An 'incident' (Article 2(64) MDR) is any
malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics or performance of a
device made available on the market, including use-error due to
ergonomic features, as well as any inadequacy in the information
supplied by the manufacturer 5 and any undesirable side-effect.
Incidents are not reportable to competent authorities under Article
87(1) MDR. However, incidents must be documented and considered in the
manufacturer's quality management system and reported in accordance with
requirements outlined in Article 88 MDR. 6

medical devices (MDD) and Directive 90/385/EEC on the approximation of
the laws of the Member States relating to active implantable medical
devices (AIMDD)) and is not applicable under the MDR. 2 For definition

4 Please note this document is intended to be updated to include the
IVDR. 5 The general requirements regarding the 'information supplied by
the manufacturer' are outlined in Section 23 of Annex I MDR and a
definition is provided in EN ISO 15223-1:2021. The information supplied
by the manufacturer should be regarded as part of the medical device or
accessory. For the purpose of this document, this information includes
the label (packaging or marking), instructions for use, technical
description, installation manual, quick reference guide, training
material, any promotional material, sales material and statements by the
manufacturer and other information accompanying the device (accompanying
information). 6 Trend reports (Article 88 MDR) should be reported to the
competent authority(ies) of the Member State(s) in which the incidents
occurred.

MDCG 2023-3
A 'serious incident' (Article 2(65) MDR) is an incident as outlined in
Article 2(64) MDR that has in addition, either led to or has the
potential to lead to the significant health or public health outcomes
outlined in Article 2(65)(a) to (c) MDR. More specifically, serious
incidents are the subset of incidents that directly or indirectly led,
might have led or might lead to the death or the temporary or permanent
serious deterioration in the state of health of a patient, user or other
person or posed a serious public health threat. The manufacturer must
report serious incidents in accordance with Article 87(1) to (5) MDR to
the relevant competent authority.7 8 Reportability under the MDR If an
incident is determined on first evaluation not to be a serious incident,
it must nonetheless be investigated whether it might lead to/might have
led to one of the outcomes specified in Article 2(65)(a) to (c) MDR, if
the circumstances were less fortunate (for instance without the
performance of an intervention by a third party or if there was exposure
of more vulnerable patients to the same situation, etc.). If the
manufacturer cannot exclude that the incident could potentially have led
to the outcomes specified in Article 2(65)(a) to (c) MDR, the incident
must be considered serious and reported to the relevant competent
authority. If, after becoming aware of a potentially reportable
incident, the manufacturer is uncertain about whether the incident is
reportable, it must nevertheless submit a report within the timeframe
required in accordance with Article 87(2) to (5) MDR.9 Flowchart 1 below
illustrates the process to be followed by manufacturers for the
management of incidents and serious incidents.
7
In this context, the relevant competent authority is the competent
authority of the Member State in which the serious incident occurred.
Serious incidents are to be reported to the competent authorities by
means of the Manufacturer Incident Report (MIR), which became applicable
from 1st January 2020. The MIR can be found on the European Commission
Medical Devices website: https://ec.europa.eu/docsroom/documents/41681.
8 Once Eudamed is fully functional, reports of serious incidents, will
be automatically transmitted to the notified body that issued the
certificate (Article 56 MDR) for the device in question (Article 92(9)
MDR). In the interim, manufacturers and notified bodies are advised to
agree on how that information is provided to the notified body that
issued the certificate for the device in question and may continue with
the same procedures used under the Directives (MDD and AIMDD). 9 Article

Manufacturer receives vigilance information e.g. a complaint*:
   To be considered:

Is the complaint related to an issue with the device?
From a healthcare professional, patient or user about a suspected
incident related to a device, via a competent authority, from an
economic operator e.g. the authorised representative, importer or
distributor, in the course of its own routine monitoring activities,
e.g. its post-market surveillance, post-market clinical follow-up
(possible sources: literature searches, registry data, questionnaires,
etc.)
Is the issue with the device one of the following:
- a malfunction or deterioration in its characteristic or performance,
Does the complaint fulfil the criteria of an incident under Article
2(64) MDR ?
- an inadequacy in the information supplied by the manufacturer,
No
The manufacturer does not have to report to the competent authority but
must record the complaint in its quality management system.
- an undesirable sideeffect.
Yes To be considered: Are the basic reporting criteria outlined in
question 2 of this document fulfilled? Is it an expected undesirable
sideeffect** ?
Does the incident fulfil the criteria of a serious incident under
Article 2(65) MDR ? Yes
No
The manufacturer must report in accordance with Article 87(1) MDR to the
relevant competent authority within the timelines outlined in Article
87(3) to (5) MDR as follows
The manufacturer does not have to report in accordance with Article
87(1) MDR. The manufacturer must comply with the requirements for trend
reporting in accordance with Article 88 MDR.
Any serious incident:
A serious public health threat:
must be reported immediately after causal relationship is
established/causal relationship is reasonably possible between the
device and serious incident and
must be reported immediately after the manufacturer becomes aware of the
threat and
no later than 15 days (calendar days)
no later than 2 days (calendar days)
Death or an unanticipated serious deterioration in a person's state of
health must be reported immediately after established/suspected causal
relationship between the device and serious incident and
The timelines for reporting must be considered as calendar days, each
beginning at the date of the manufacturer s awareness of the potentially
serious incident (= day 0). The reporting period begins on the day after
the date of the manufacturer s awareness of the potentially serious
incident (= day 1). See question 11 and 12 for clarification on the
reporting timelines and manufacturer awareness date.
no later than 10 days (calendar days)
* A complaint is defined in EN ISO 13485:2016 and can be described as a
written, electronic or oral communication that alleges deficiencies
related to the identity, quality, durability, reliability, usability,
safety or performance of a medical device or related to a service that
affects the performance of such medical devices. It is important to note
that complaints and information relevant for vigilance reporting are not
only externally generated but can also be created due to the
manufacturer s own activities for routine monitoring of a device s
safety and performance. ** Expected undesirable side-effects are
clearly documented in the product information and quantified in the
technical documentation and subject to trend reporting pursuant to
Article 88 MDR (see question 8 for elaboration of undesirable
side-effects).

MDCG 2023-3
2. What are the basic reporting criteria for a serious incident? Any
incident which meets all three basic reporting criteria A -- C listed
below is considered a serious incident and must be reported to the
relevant competent authority: A. an incident (Article 2(64) MDR) has
occurred, and B. the incident directly or indirectly led, might have led
or might lead to any of the outcomes of a serious incident (Article
2(65) MDR), and C. a causal relationship between the serious incident
and the manufacturer's device has been established, is reasonably
possible or suspected. Elaboration of the reporting criteria A - C is
provided below Criterion A: an incident has occurred Examples of an
incident can include: 
    
a malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics or performance of
the device, e.g. a device that fails or is losing its ability to achieve
its intended purpose (Article 2(12) MDR) when used as indicated in the
information supplied by the manufacturer (see question 4 for further
clarification of a malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics
or performance a device), a deterioration in the characteristics of the
device that is related to manufacturing errors, e.g. sterilisation
process failures, a use error due to ergonomic features, e.g. a use
error caused by a mismatch between the user interface10 and the physical
or medical condition of the intended user (see question 7 for further
clarification of use-error due to ergonomic features), any inadequacy in
the information supplied by the manufacturer, e.g. insufficient
information on how to maintain, adjust or calibrate the device in the
instructions for use that can lead to a use error, unclear instructions
in the labelling or the manufacturer's instructions for use, e.g. the
information is not written in a way that is suitable for/readily
understood by the intended user, undesirable side-effects e.g. allergic
skin reactions such as allergy to nickel or wound therapies (see
question 8 for further clarification of undesirable side-effects).
Criterion B: the incident directly or indirectly led, might have led or
might lead to any of the outcomes of a serious incident For this
criterion to be fulfilled, it is sufficient that an incident associated
with the device happened and the incident was such that, if it occurred
again, it might have led or might lead to any of the following outcomes:
  
death of a patient, user or other person, the temporary or permanent
serious deterioration of a patient's, user's or other person's state
of health,* a serious public health threat.**
According to EN 62366-1:2015, the 'user interface' is the means by which
the user and the device interact. The user interface covers all the
elements of the medical device with which the user interacts, including
the physical aspects of the device as well as visual, auditory, tactile
displays and is not limited to the software interface. For the purpose
of this document, the information supplied by the manufacturer such as
the accompanying information is considered part of the device and its
user interface. 10

MDCG 2023-3
* A serious deterioration in state of health of a patient, user or
other person can include: I. a life-threatening illness or injury, II.
permanent or temporary impairment of a body structure or a body function
(including impairments leading to diagnosed psychological trauma), III.
a condition necessitating hospitalisation or prolongation of existing
hospitalisation, IV. medical or surgical intervention to prevent I or
II, examples of this can be:  professional medical care or additional
unplanned medical treatment,  a clinically relevant increase in the
duration of a surgical procedure V. a chronic disease, VI. foetal
distress, foetal death or any congenital abnormality (including
congenital physical or mental impairment) or birth defects. Please note
that any indirect harm that may occur as a consequence of the medical
decision or action taken/not taken on the basis of information or
result(s) provided by a device can also lead to serious incidents,
including a serious deterioration in the state of health of a patient,
user or other person (see question 3 for clarification of indirect
harm). ** A serious public health threat (Article 2(66) MDR) is an
event which could result in imminent risk of death, serious
deterioration in a person's state of health, or serious illness, that
may require prompt remedial action, and that may cause significant
morbidity or mortality in humans, or that is unusual or unexpected for
the given place and time. These events would include: I. II.
the possibility of multiple deaths occurring at short intervals, events
that are of significant and unexpected nature such that they become
alarming as a potential public health hazard.
Examples of serious public health threats can be the following
(non-exhaustive list):  contagious illnesses, such as human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), Ebola,
Zika virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Coronavirus
disease (COVID-19),  events involving high risk of exposure to a
disease (e.g. cancer) after use of a medical device, which affects a
significant number of the population, or a specific patient population
(diabetics, cardiac patients, etc.) or a vulnerable population
(children, pregnant women, etc.),  exposure to toxic compounds with a
potentially negative/harmful effect on humans,  widespread distribution
of falsified or incorrectly labelled devices leading to multiple serious
incidents, e.g. distribution of non-sterile devices labelled as sterile,
 cyberattack related to life supporting or life-saving devices. A
serious threat to public health will in principle not be limited to one
isolated case or individual patient issue, and identifying these events
may depend on signal detection or trending of multiple events of the
same nature/typology, same root cause, etc.

Criterion C: causal relationship between the serious incident and the
manufacturer's device has been established or is reasonably possible or
suspected The manufacturer has to investigate if there is a causal
relationship between the serious incident and their device or if such a
causal relationship is reasonably possible, i.e. the device cannot
reasonably be excluded as a contributory cause of the serious incident.
In assessing the link between their device and the serious incident, the
manufacturer should take account of factors such as:     
clinical or medical plausibility, the opinion of healthcare
professionals, the results of the manufacturer's own preliminary
assessment, known information provided in the technical documentation
and evidence of previous similar serious incidents, other relevant
evidence held by the manufacturer.
Establishing or identifying the link between the manufacturer's device
and the serious incident may be difficult, especially when there are
multiple devices and drugs involved. In complex situations, it should be
assumed that the device may have or potentially could have contributed
to the serious incident, and the manufacturer should therefore be
cautious in its evaluation and conclusions. In case of doubt, the
manufacturer must nevertheless submit the report referred to in Article
87(1) MDR.11 3. How can incidents indirectly lead to a serious
deterioration of health? In a number of cases, the device may, due to
its intended use, not directly(or instantly) lead to physical injury or
damage to a person's health but lead to indirect harm. Indirect harm may
occur as a consequence of the medical decision, action taken or lack of
such on the basis of information or result(s) provided by the device or
as a consequence of a treatment. Indirect harm, due to an incident that
meets or has the potential to meet the outcomes of a serious incident
must be reported in accordance with Article 87(1) to (5) MDR. Examples
of indirect harm may include:  a misdiagnosis,  a delayed diagnosis, 
delayed treatment,  inappropriate treatment,  absence of treatment, 
transfusion of inappropriate materials.

4. With reference to Article 2(64) MDR, what is meant by a 'malfunction
or deterioration in the characteristics or performance of a device'? A
'malfunction12 or deterioration13 in the characteristics or performance
of a device' can be described as a situation where a device fails to
achieve, or is unable to uphold, the performance (Article 2(22) MDR)
intended by the manufacturer when used in accordance with the
information supplied with the device. Examples of device malfunctions
may include the following:    
a device that due to a sudden software error fails to make correct
assessments and provides an incorrect treatment (dosage) to the patient,
electrical short circuit causing the device to catch fire or stop
working, premature battery depletion e.g. a malfunction resulting in
high current drain depleting the device battery faster than indicated in
the instructions for use, a device that breaks during use although it
was used/handled in accordance with the instructions for use.
Examples of deteriorations in the characteristics or performance of a
device may include the following:  a gradual occlusion of fluid or gas
path, change in resistance to flow or electrical conductivity of a
device as a result of ageing or repeated use,  a sensor drift caused by
physical changes, e.g. a gradual decrease in accuracy on a sensor caused
by physical changes such as airborne pollutants (dust, chemicals, vapor
and other contaminants),  UV degradation of a device e.g. cracking or
disintegration of device materials due to ultraviolet radiation, such as
sunlight exposure,  elasticity changes (increase or decrease), e.g. of
compression stockings that due to an elasticity increase are not
suitable for their intended use anymore,  failure of a device component
or other types of significant loss of electrical, material or mechanical
integrity of a device due to wear or fatigue. The manufacturer should
always conduct a root cause investigation when a device, used in
accordance with information supplied by the manufacturer itself, fails
to achieve or uphold its performance. 5. Who is considered as the 'user'
of a device? For the purpose of this document, the 'user' (Article 2(37)
MDR) is any healthcare institution, healthcare professional or lay
person (e.g. caregiver, patient) who uses the device, or persons
installing or maintaining the device. The user of a device can also be
referenced as the operator, e.g. in standards.
See also the following definition of a 'malfunction' provided in EN ISO
14155:2020: 'a malfunction is a failure of a device to perform in
accordance with its intended purpose when used in accordance with the
manufacturer's instructions for use or to meet its performance
specifications'. 13 For the purpose of this document, the following
definition of deterioration was taken into account: 'the action or
process of a device becoming impaired or inferior in quality, function
or condition' (Merriam-Webster.com Dictionary, Merriam-Webster,
https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/deterioration). 12
Page 8 of 18
Medical Devices Medical Device Coordination Group Document
MDCG 2023-3
6. What is a 'use error' in comparison to 'abnormal use'? A 'use error'
is when the user's action or lack thereof while using the device leads
to a different result or outcome than that expected by the user or
intended by the manufacturer.14 Use errors can be caused by a user's
failure to pay attention, memory lapses or mistakes during device use,
or lack of understanding or knowledge in relation to device use. Such
use errors do not fall within the definition of an incident. However,
use errors that are caused by the ergonomic features of a device qualify
as incidents and in case of serious incidents reportable under Article
87(1) MDR (see question 7 for elaboration). Use errors must nevertheless
be documented and handled within the manufacturer's quality management
system. 'Abnormal use' is the deliberate violation of the intended use
of a device. It is a deliberate act or omission of an act by the user
that is counter to or violates normal use of a device, and is beyond any
further reasonable means of interface-related risk control by the
manufacturer. An example of abnormal use may include off-label use of a
device such as a doctor that, based on a medical decision, uses a device
for a different indication than indicated in the manufacturer's
instructions for use. Abnormal use of a device, must be documented and
handled within the manufacturer's quality management system.15
7. What is a 'use-error due to ergonomic features' as mentioned in
Article 2(64) MDR? 'Use-error due to ergonomic features' can be
described as use errors caused by device features that were designed to
allow the device to be easily, effectively and safely used by the
intended user. Ergonomic features can be described as the physical
features of a device that are designed to facilitate and ensure that the
interaction between the user and the device is safe, effective and
efficient. The ergonomic features of the device includes components such
as measurement and monitoring features, display scales, alarms, software
menu and any other factor related to the user interface. Use errors due
to ergonomic features may be caused by a mismatch between the device
features (including the information provided in the instructions for
use) and factors such as the user profile16 and/or the environment in
which the device is intended to be used. It should be noted that in some
cases, use errors caused by ergonomic features may not be immediately
identified and can lead to serious outcomes due to the unintentional
nature of the 14
According to EN ISO 14971:2019 and EN 62366-1:2015, use errors include
the inability of the user to complete their task when using the device
(Note 1, 3.52, EN ISO 14971:2019). Furthermore, according to the EN ISO
14971:2019 the occurrence of an unexpected physiological response of the
patient when using the device is not by itself considered a use error
(note 4, 3.52, EN ISO 14971:2019) and a malfunction of a device that
leads to an unexpected result, is also not considered a use error (note
5,3.52, EN ISO 14971:2019). 15 Based on data, e.g. from complaints,
related to abnormal use, manufacturers might be able to identify
possible systematic misuse or off-label use of their device, and verify
that the device's intended purpose is appropriate and, where relevant,
identify the need for initiating a field safety corrective action. 16
According to EN 62366-1:2015/AMD1, the user profile can include 'the
mental, physical and demographic traits of an intended user group, as
well as any special characteristics, such as occupational skills, job
requirements and working conditions, which can have a bearing on design
decisions related to the device'.
Page 9 of 18

MDCG 2023-3
error and the potential that the user is not aware of its occurrence.
This note is especially important for devices where the patient is
responsible for installing or adjusting their treatment e.g.
drug-delivery devices or devices with a diagnostic or measuring
function. Use errors due to ergonomic features must in the case of a
serious incident, be reported in accordance with Article 87(1) to (5)
MDR or in case of incidents reported in accordance with Article 88 MDR.
8. What is an 'undesirable side-effect' and how is it reported within
the vigilance system? An 'undesirable side-effect' under the MDR should
be understood as any unintended and unwanted medical manifestation in
the human body, as a consequence of the normal use of a device.17
Undesirable side-effects are not the result of a malfunction,
deterioration in the device's characteristics or performance, or an
inadequacy in the information supplied by the manufacturer. An
unsuccessful treatment (or treatment failure) should not be considered
an undesirable side effect. For the purpose of this guidance,
undesirable side-effects can be expected or unexpected and are
considered as incidents under the MDR (Article 2(64) MDR). 18 Expected
undesirable side-effects must be clearly documented in the product
information, and quantified in the manufacturer's technical
documentation. They must also be acceptable when weighed against the
evaluated benefits to the patient and/or user arising from the achieved
performance of the device during normal conditions of use (Section 8 of
Annex I MDR). 19 Expected undesirable side-effects must be reported in
accordance with the requirements for trend reporting pursuant to Article
88 MDR. If the manufacturer cannot demonstrate that a potentially
serious incident is an expected undesirable side-effect within the
deadlines set out in Article 87(3) to (5) MDR, it must submit a
Manufacturer Incident report (MIR) within the reporting timelines.
Unexpected undesirable side-effects are not considered in the
manufacturer's risk analysis, quantified in the manufacturer's technical
documentation or documented in the product information. If they occur,
they are to be handled like all incidents. That means that, if they
qualify as serious incidents within the meaning of Article 2(65) MDR,
such side-effects must be reported in accordance with Article 87(1) MDR
as individual serious incident reports (i.e. individual MIRs). 9.
Article 87(5) MDR outlines the timelines for manufacturers to report an
unanticipated serious deterioration in a person's state of health. When
is a serious deterioration in a person's state of health considered
'unanticipated'? A serious deterioration in a person's state of health,
is considered 'unanticipated' if the condition leading to the
deterioration was not considered in the manufacturer's risk analysis. A
serious deterioration in a person's state of health is anticipated if it
was considered in the manufacturer's risk analysis and documented in the
risk management report. It should be noted that the terms 'undesirable
side-effects' and 'side-effects' are used synonymously in the MDR. In
addition to footnote 17, note also for reporting purposes that;
'identified side-effects, expected side-effects expected undesirable
side-effects and unknown side-effects' as mentioned in the MDR should
all be understood as 'undesirable side-effects' and fall under the
definition of an incident (Article 2(64) MDR). 19 In this context,
reference to 'patient' should be understood as the individual patient
i.e. acceptable in terms of the individual patient benefit. 17 18
Page 10 of 18
Medical Devices Medical Device Coordination Group Document
MDCG 2023-3
For a serious deterioration in the state of health, the manufacturer
must ensure there is:  
documented evidence that a risk analysis was used to eliminate or reduce
the risk related to these events as far as possible, or the risk is
included in the information supplied by the manufacturer to the user,
e.g. in the instructions for use.
10. With reference to the timelines for the reporting requirements
outlined in Article 87 MDR, what is meant by 'immediately' and 'without
undue delay'? For the purpose of this document, 'immediately' and
'without undue delay' should both be understood as without any delay
that is intentionally or negligently caused by the manufacturer. As a
general rule, the report outlined in Article 87(1) MDR must be provided
without any delay or any delay that the manufacturer cannot justify and
no later than the timelines outlined in Article 87(2) to (5) MDR. To
ensure timely reporting, the manufacturer can submit an initial MIR
which can be followed by a follow-up report (Article 87(6) MDR).
Question 11 of this document provides more clarification on how to apply
the reporting timelines outlined in Article 87(3) to (5) MDR.
11. How to apply the reporting timelines defined by Article 87(3) to
(5) MDR? In accordance with the MDR, the reporting referred to in
Article 87(1) MDR must take account of the severity of the serious
incident. The timelines for reporting serious incidents must be
considered as calendar days meaning the reporting periods include
weekdays, public holidays, Saturdays and Sundays20. As a general rule,
the reporting period begins on the day after the awareness date of a
potentially serious incident21 at 0:0:1 AM22. The awareness date (day=0)
refers to the date when the manufacturer is first made aware or receives
information of the occurrence of the (potentially) serious incident and
not after it has conducted its investigation. See also question 12 for
elaboration of the manufacturer awareness date. The reporting timelines
outlined in the MDR are the following: 
any serious incident, that did not involve a death or an unanticipated
serious deterioration in a person's state of health, must be reported
immediately after a causal relationship between device and the serious
incident has been established or is
20
Article 3(3) Regulation (EEC, EURATOM) NO 1182/71 of the Council of 3
June 1971 determining the rules applicable to periods, dates and time
limits, OJ L 124, 8.6.1971, p. 1. For the calculation of the period,
Articles 3(4) and (5) of Regulation (EEC, EURATOM) NO 1182/71 needs to
be considered, which state: "Where the last day of a period expressed
otherwise than in hours is a public holiday, Sunday or Saturday, the
period shall end with the expiry of the last hour of the following
working day" (Article 3(5)) and "Any period of two days or more shall
include at least two working days" (Article 3(4) of that Regulation). 21
See Article 3(1), second subparagraph Regulation (EEC, EURATOM) NO
1182/71: "Where a period expressed in days, [...] is to be calculated
from the moment at which an event occurs [...], the day during which
that event occurs [...] shall not be considered as falling within the
period in question." 22 Article 3(2) (b) Regulation (EEC, EURATOM) NO
1182/71:"beginning of the first hour of the first day".
Page 11 of 18
Medical Devices Medical Device Coordination Group Document
MDCG 2023-3
reasonably possible and no later than 15 days after the awareness date
of the serious incident (Article 87(3) MDR), 
a serious public health threat must be reported immediately, and not
later than 2 days after the manufacturer becomes aware of that threat
(Article 87(4) MDR),

death or an unanticipated serious deterioration in a person's state of
health must be reported immediately after a causal relationship between
the device and the serious incident is established or as soon as such
relationship is suspected, and no later than 10 days after the awareness
date of the serious incident (Article 87(5) MDR).
In the exceptional cases where a manufacturer initially determines that
an incident does not meet the reporting requirements of a serious
incident, and then some time later obtains new information that impacts
or changes the initial reportability assessment, which results in the
reporting requirements of a serious incident being met, the period of
reporting in this case begins on the date on which the manufacturer
received the information that determined that the incident is reportable
(Article 2(65) MDR). In both situations i.e., the general rule and the
exceptional case, the period ends on the 15th, 2nd or 10th day
thereafter (more specifically at 11:59:59 PM23). However, if this (last)
day is a public holiday, Saturday or Sunday the deadline is moved to the
following working day automatically24. Nevertheless, in line with
Article 87(3), (4) and (5) MDR requirement to report 'immediately' but
not later than the period provided for in those provisions, it is highly
recommended for the manufacturer to report immediately or as early as
possible in time. A delay in submitting an initial report e.g. due to
incomplete information provided by the healthcare facility, end user or
other relevant parties, is not deemed justified. As outlined in Article
87(6) MDR, the manufacturer can submit an initial MIR followed up by a
follow-up report providing additional information related to the
(potentially) serious incident and progress on the incident
investigation(s). Any report must not be unduly delayed because of
incomplete information. The example below demonstrates the timelines for
the exceptional case described above, in which the manufacturer is first
made aware of an incident, and concludes that it does not meet the
reporting requirements of a serious incident, and later obtains new
information that impacts or changes the manufacturer's previous
determination regarding the need to report. Example A manufacturer
receives a complaint on 1st June 2022. The manufacturer determines that
the criteria of a serious incident were not met and therefore, does not
submit a MIR to the relevant competent authority. The manufacturer
subsequently receives additional information on 1st July 2022. Upon
review of this information, the manufacturer determines that the
complaint is a serious incident. The manufacturer must submit a MIR at
the latest by 16th of July 2022. Variation of the above example: Article
3(2) (b) Regulation (EEC, EURATOM) NO 1182/71:"expiry of the last hour
of the last day". See Article 3(4), first subparagraph Regulation (EEC,
EURATOM) NO 1182/71: "Where the last day of a period expressed otherwise
than in hours is a public holiday, Sunday or Saturday, the period shall
end with the expiry of the last hour of the following working day." 23
24
Page 12 of 18
Medical Devices Medical Device Coordination Group Document
MDCG 2023-3
On 2nd July 2022, the manufacturer was made aware that the patient died
on 2nd July 2022. Since the consequence of the serious incident is now a
patient death, a report must be submitted no later than 10 days after
awareness date of the serious incident. Therefore, a MIR must be
submitted at the latest by 12th July 2022. In conclusion, it is the
earliest date of reporting which should be considered.
12. With reference to the reporting timelines of a serious incident
pursuant to Article 87 MDR, what is considered as the 'manufacturer
awareness date'? For the purpose of this document, the 'manufacturer
awareness date' is the date when the first employee or representative of
the manufacturer's organisation, receives information (e.g. a complaint)
regarding the potentially serious incident. If the handling of these
incidents is performed by the authorised representative or if the
manufacturer has outsourced its complaint and incident handling
activities to another natural or legal person (e.g. a subcontractor),
then reference to 'manufacturer's organisation' in the context of
awareness date will also apply to this organisation. In the exceptional
cases, where a manufacturer initially determines that an incident does
not meet the reporting requirements of a serious incident and then later
obtains new information that impacts or changes the manufacturer's
previous determination regarding the need to report, the serious
incident must be reported to the relevant competent authority and
indicated in the MIR. In the MIR, the manufacturer should provide the
relevant dates in the following two fields: 
1.2.c. 'Manufacturer awareness date' (in this field, the manufacturer
should insert the initial awareness date of the incident).

Section 5 'General comments' (in this field, the manufacturer should
insert the date in which it received the information that determined
that the incident is reportable (the 'Manufacturer awareness date of
reportability))25.
Within the general comments in Section 5 of the MIR, the manufacturer
should also explain the difference between the two dates (the
manufacturer awareness date and awareness date of reportability). It
should be noted that if the manufacturer is uncertain about whether the
incident is a serious incident, it must nevertheless submit a MIR within
the timelines laid down in Article 87(2) to (5) MDR. An example is
provided below to demonstrate how to correctly apply the awareness date
in the MIR in the exceptional cases (described above) that a MIR was
initially not submitted to the relevant competent authority as the
requirements for reporting a serious incident were not met. However,
upon receipt of subsequent information that the criteria for a serious
incident reporting was met, a MIR was submitted to the relevant
competent authority.
25
Please note that it is intended to update version 7.2.1 of the MIR to
include a field for 'Manufacturer awareness date of reportability'.
Until the publication of the updated MIR, manufacturers should include
this information in Section 5 'General comments' instead.
Page 13 of 18
Medical Devices Medical Device Coordination Group Document
MDCG 2023-3
Example A manufacturer receives a complaint on 1st July 2022. The
manufacturer determines that the requirements for a serious incident are
not fulfilled and does not submit a MIR to the relevant competent
authority. The manufacturer subsequently receives additional information
on 1st August 2022 and upon review of this information, the manufacturer
determines that the complaint is a serious incident. The manufacturer
should then submit a MIR within timelines outlined under the applicable
sections of the MDR, i.e. immediately and not later than 15, 2 and 10
days (Article 87(3) to (5) MDR), from (the day after) 1st August 2022.
In the MIR, the manufacturer should insert the dates as follows: 
1.2.c.
Manufacturer awareness date: 1st July 2022.

Section 5
General comments:
1st August 2022 and an explanation of the difference between the two
dates.
13. Why does the MIR in section 1.2(d) have a report type named 'Final
(Non-reportable incident)' and when can it be used? The report type
'Final, (Non-reportable incident)' is included under section 1. 2(d) in
the MIR for cases in which the manufacturer has submitted a MIR to the
relevant competent authority, but establishes through its investigation
that the criteria for a serious incident (Article 87(1) MDR) were not
met. The report type 'Final (Non-reportable incident)', must be used in
the cases below. 
According to Article 87(7) MDR, in case of uncertainty, the manufacturer
is obliged to report a potentially serious incident within the timelines
outlined in Article 87(3) to (5) MDR. However, it is possible that the
manufacturer, within this timeframe, is unable to establish whether the
reporting requirements outlined in Article 87(1)(a) MDR are fulfilled.
After submitting a MIR to the relevant competent authority, further root
cause investigation of the device in question (after the reporting
timelines) could clarify that the requirements of a serious incident
were not fulfilled and the case was not reportable.

Cases in which the manufacturer's analysis of additional information,
received after it has submitted a MIR to the relevant competent
authority, reveals that the reporting requirements of Article 87(1) MDR
were not fulfilled.
In the abovementioned cases, the manufacturer can select the box 'Final
(Non-reportable incident)' under section 1.2 (d) of the MIR and provide
a rationale for its conclusion in section 4.2(b). It should be noted
that the report type 'Final (Non-reportable incident)' may also be used
for cases where the manufacturer has received a report of a potentially
serious incident from the competent authorities (Article 87(11) MDR) but
establishes within the timelines outlined in Article 87(3) to (5) MDR
that the requirements of a serious incident are not fulfilled. In such
cases, the manufacturer can submit a final MIR selecting the report type
'Final (Non-reportable incident)' and provide a rationale for its
conclusion in section 4.2(b). Page 14 of 18
Medical Devices Medical Device Coordination Group Document
MDCG 2023-3
If the manufacturer has not finalised its root cause analysis or
established the cause and/or contributing factors, the case cannot be
considered to qualify as non-reportable. In such cases, a MIR with the
report type 'Final (Non-reportable) incident' should not be submitted to
the relevant competent authority. 14. What is a 'field safety corrective
action'? A 'field safety corrective action (FSCA)' (Article 2(68) MDR)
is a corrective action taken by a manufacturer for technical or medical
reasons to either prevent or reduce the risk of a serious incident,
which is associated with a device that is made available on the market.
A FSCA may include:        
the return of a device to the supplier or a recall26, a device exchange,
a device modification, retrofit by purchaser of manufacturer's
modification or design change, a device destruction, advice given by
manufacturer regarding the use of the device, such as additional
information on maintenance, cleaning instructions, and training and/or
the follow-up of patients, users or others, recommended
inspections/examination by device user (e.g. regular professional checks
of proper functioning in a testing setting), changes of
software/firmware in the device, including device update (e.g. version
rollback).
It should be noted that advice given by a manufacturer may include
modifications to the clinical management of patients to address a risk
of death or a serious deterioration in the state of health related
specifically to the characteristics of a device. An example of this can
be cases involving implantable devices where it is often clinically
unjustifiable to explant the device. Therefore, special patient
follow-up or treatment, irrespective of whether any affected unimplanted
devices remain available for return, constitutes measures to be included
in a FSCA. A FSCA must be communicated/transmitted without undue delay
for the attention of users or customers of the device in question
through a field safety notice (FSN) (Article 2(69) MDR) sent by the
manufacturer. Unless duly justified by the situation of the individual
Member State (e.g. a translation error in the instructions for use that
appears only in certain languages and therefore affects only specific
countries), the content of the FSN must be consistent in all Member
States. The FSN must be edited in an official Union language or
languages determined by the Member State in which the FSCA is taken. The
MDR requirements for the content of the FSN are outlined in paragraph 2
of Article 89(8) MDR. Example of a FSCA conducted by a manufacturer: As
part of its post-market surveillance activities, the manufacturer
identifies a systematic device malfunction.
26
Removals from the market for purely commercial non-safety related
reasons are not included.
Page 15 of 18
Medical Devices Medical Device Coordination Group Document
MDCG 2023-3
If the affected devices are available on the market and they have or
potentially could lead to a serious incident, the manufacturer must
initiate a FSCA to either prevent or reduce the risk of such incidents.
The FSCA implemented by the manufacturer may include permanent or
temporary changes to the device's labelling or instructions for use or a
recall of all affected devices that are available on the market. The
manufacturer must without delay inform the relevant competent
authority(ies) in the Member State(s) in which the FSCA has been or is
to be undertaken. Furthermore, the manufacturer must also, ensure that
information about the FSCA is brought without delay to the attention of
the affected users by means of a FSN. 15. With reference to Article
87(1)(b) MDR, what is meant with '..including any field safety
corrective action undertaken in a third country...'? For FSCAs
undertaken in a third country, where the device is also legally made
available on the Union market,27 all relevant competent authorities must
be notified unless the reason for the FSCA is limited to devices made
available in the third country. Example An example of such a FSCA would
be where a recall of a device has taken place in a third country due to
a malfunction with certain lots. If the lots affected by this recall
have also been made available on the Union market, then all relevant
competent authorities must be notified of the FSCA. 16. Within the scope
of Article 89 MDR on analysis of serious incidents and field safety
corrective actions, what is an 'evaluating competent authority'? The
'evaluating competent authority' is the national competent authority of
the Member State responsible for the assessment of the risks arising
from reported serious incidents that occur within its territory, and/or
of the adequacy of FSCAs envisaged or undertaken, within its territory,
by the manufacturer (Article 89(2) and (3) MDR) In the scenarios
provided below, the evaluating competent authority is: 
For serious incidents: the competent authority of the Member State in
which the serious incident occurred.

For FSCA(s): the competent authority(ies) of the Member State(s) in
which the FSCA is being or is to be undertaken, e.g. Member States in
which the devices affected by the FSCA are made available. The competent
authority in the Member State in which the manufacturer or its
authorised representative has its registered place of business must
always be informed of the FSCA, even if it is not amongst the Member
States in which the FSCA is being or is to be undertaken.
The 'Union market' refers to the territories of the European Union
Member States, and due to the European Economic Area (EEA) is extended
to Norway, Lichtenstein and Iceland, and via the Customs Union Agreement
to Türkiye. For Türkiye, please see also the 'Notice to stakeholders
EU-Turkey Customs Union Agreement in the field of medical devices' on
the Commission website. 27

MDCG 2023-3
In the context of commenting on the content of the draft FSN as outlined
in paragraph 1 of Article 89(8) MDR, manufacturers must, except in cases
of urgency, submit the draft FSN, to the evaluating competent authority
to allow it to review and make comments (Article 89(8) MDR).28 In the
cases referred to in 89(9) MDR, the draft FSN must be submitted to the
designated coordinating competent authority. In all cases, the final FSN
must be transmitted to all evaluating competent authorities. 
In the cases referred to in Article 89(9) MDR, the evaluating competent
authorities can actively participate in a procedure with the aim of
coordinating the assessments referred to in Article 89(3) MDR. Unless
otherwise agreed between the competent authorities participating in the
coordinated procedure, the coordinating competent authority must be the
competent authority of the Member State in which the manufacturer or its
authorised representative has its registered place of business. Once
designated, the coordinating competent authority must through Eudamed or
alternative means inform the manufacturer, the other competent
authorities and the Commission that it has assumed this role. 29
17. Where can I find information on vigilance reporting in Eudamed?
Eudamed is the new European database on medical devices, which will
centralise all relevant information on devices which have been placed on
the Union market. The database is defined and described in Article 33
MDR and the specific requirements related to vigilance are outlined in
Article 92 MDR. Until Eudamed becomes fully functional, competent
authorities, economic operators and other relevant parties should follow
the 'MDCG 2021-1 Guidance on harmonised administrative practices and
alternative technical solutions until EUDAMED is fully functional',
which has been endorsed by the Medical Device Coordination Group (MDCG).
The MDCG guidance details alternative temporary solutions for
implementing certain MDR provisions related to Eudamed and on exchange
of information to enable Member States and other relevant parties to
meet their obligations under the MDR until the full functionality of the
database. Information of how to act and alternative mechanisms to be
used to exchange data in case of technical unavailability or malfunction
of Eudamed after it is fully functional, can be found in the 'COMMISSION
IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) 2021/2078 of 26 November 2021 laying down
rules for the application of Regulation (EU) 2017/745 of the European
Parliament and of the Council as regards the European Database on
Medical Devices (Eudamed)'.30
28
The manufacturer should allow 48 working hours for receipt of comment on
the FSN unless the nature of the FSCA dictates a shorter timescale e.g.
for a serious public health threat. 29 Until Eudamed is fully
functional, alternative means provided in the following guidance are
applicable:

18. In accordance with Articles 10, 13 and 14 MDR, manufacturers,
importers and distributors are required to inform competent authorities
of devices that present or are considered to present a serious risk.
What is meant by a 'serious risk'? For the purpose of this document, a
'serious risk' is defined as a situation where a serious harm resulting
from the use of a device that might affect patients, users or the public
is likely to happen31. A serious risk may include situations where the
effects of the risk are not immediate. For cases involving a device that
presents a serious risk, the manufacturer, importer or distributor must
immediately inform the competent authorities of the Member States in
which they made the device available and, where applicable, the notified
body that issued a certificate for the device in accordance with Article
56 MDR. 32 19. What is a 'Periodic Summary Report'? A 'Periodic summary
report' (PSR) is an alternative reporting regime by which the
manufacturer, in agreement with the respective national competent
authority that is coordinating the periodic summary reporting (and in
consultation with the competent authorities referred to in Article 92(8)
(a) MDR), can report similar serious incidents with the same device or
device type in a consolidated way. Criteria for periodic summary
reporting include situations where; the root cause has been identified,
a FSCA has been implemented or where the serious incidents are common
and well documented. The requirements for periodic summary reporting are
outlined in Article 87(9) MDR.
20. What are the criteria for a 'common and well documented' serious
incident? A 'common and well documented serious incident' as referenced
in Article 87(9) MDR, must be clearly identified in the manufacturer's
risk analysis and should have led to incident reports, which have been
assessed by the manufacturer and the relevant competent authority. The
serious incident and the root cause should be clinically well-known
(i.e. a certain qualitative or quantitative predictability is
established) by the manufacturer.
See also Article 2(23) MDR for definition of a 'risk'. For information
on the reporting obligations of importers and distributors, including
for devices presenting a serious risk see also MDCG 2021-27 - Questions
and Answers on Articles 13 & 14 of Regulation (EU) 2017/745 and

1 Introduction 1.1 What is the Periodic Safety Update Report The
Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) has been introduced in Article 86
of the Medical Device Regulation (MDR) 2017/745. The introduction of the
PSUR requirement under the MDR requires a more consistent, standardized
and systematic review of all Post-Market Surveillance1 (PMS) data by
manufacturers of class IIa, class IIb and class III devices. The PSUR
summarises the results and conclusions of the analysis of the
post-market surveillance data gathered as a result of the Post-Market
Surveillance Plan (see section 2.1). The range of PMS data and level of
detail of information examined in a PSUR, the modalities for aggregating
and assessing the data or the grouping of devices within the same PSUR
will depend mainly on the type of device(s) covered, the time span
during which the manufacturer has placed them on the EU market and the
post-market experience gained with these devices. The main objective of
this guidance document is to assist manufacturers to implement the legal
requirements laid down in Article 86 MDR. However, manufacturers should
have reasonable time to adapt their quality management systems and
sufficient flexibility 2 when they draw up and update a PSUR as long as
they can demonstrate that it is in line with Article 86 MDR. Moreover,
PSURs already drawn up or in the process of being prepared when this
guidance is published should not be expected to have followed this
guidance, as long as those PSURs comply with the legal requirements laid
down in Article 86 MDR.
1.2 Terminology "Device certification date": The "device certification
date" used in this guidance should be understood as one of the
following: -
Date of issuance of the EU technical documentation assessment
certificate according to Annex IX (including chapter II). Date of
issuance of the EU type-examination certificate according to Annex X.
Date of issuance of the EU product verification certificate for class
IIa devices according to section 3 of Annex XI. The date of signing of
the Declaration of Conformity for Annex IX (Chapters I & III) devices.
Date of the issuance of the statement required in Annex XIII, section 1
for custommade devices3.
Legacy devices4 should be understood as devices5, which, in accordance
with Article 120(3) of the MDR, are placed on the market after the MDR
date of application (DoA) and until the 1
MDR, Article 2(60) See point 11 of MDCG 2022-14 Position paper
"Transition to the MDR and IVDR -- Notified body capacity and
availability of medical devices and IVDs" 3 MDR, Article 2(3) 2
Page 4 of 40
Medical Devices Medical Device Coordination Group Document
MDCG 2022-21
end of the transition period laid down in Article 120(3) MDR if certain
conditions are fulfilled. Those devices can be:  devices which are
class I devices under Directive 93/42/EEC (MDD), for which an EC
declaration of conformity was drawn up prior to 26 May 2021 and for
which the conformity assessment procedure under the MDR requires the
involvement of a notified body;  devices covered by a valid EC
certificate issued in accordance with Directive 90/385/EEC (AIMDD) or
the MDD prior to 26 May 2021. Leading device: The "leading device" in a
group of devices covered by the same PSUR corresponds to the highest
risk class device. In the case when there are several devices with the
same risk classification, the manufacturer should assign a leading
device. Old devices4 are those devices that were placed on the market
before 26 May 2021 in accordance with the AIMDD or the MDD or in
accordance with the applicable rules before the Directives had entered
into force. PSUR Web Form: Template that contains all the information
that will be available in Eudamed for the PSUR. This form details
information regarding the medical device, manufacturer, NB and the
management of the PSUR process. PSUR reference number: The PSUR
reference number is the unique identifier that the manufacturer must
assign to a PSUR. It should remain the same during the whole PSUR
lifetime. PSUR version number: an incremental number attributed to each
update(s) of the PSUR which has been made available by a manufacturer
and allowing to identify and trace them. The term "annually" for drawing
up the first PSUR for legacy devices should be understood as occurring
during the course of the calendar year following MDR date of
application. The term "every two years" for drawing up the first PSUR
for legacy devices should be understood as occurring during the course
of the second calendar year following MDR date of application.
1.3 Scope of the guidance This guidance is applicable to medical devices
which have been certified under the MDR and to devices which have been
certified under MDD 93/42/EEC or AIMDD 90/385/EEC except for devices
which have stopped being placed on the EU market before the MDR date of
entry into application (DoA) (see section 3.1). It does not apply to in
vitro diagnostic medical devices which have been certified under IVDR
(EU) 2017/746 or IVDD 98/79/EEC for which a specific guidance is
intended.

MDCG 2022-21
Manufacturers of class I devices do not have to prepare a PSUR; instead,
they should prepare a Post-Market Surveillance Report (PMSR) as detailed
in Article 85. This guidance, although not covering PMSR, may provide
useful suggestions on how information can be presented.
2 General considerations 2.1 PSUR objectives The PSUR objectives are
double:
2.1.1 Identification and evaluation of changes of the benefit-risk
profile The main objective of a PSUR is to present a summary of the
results and conclusions of the analyses of post-market surveillance data
relating to a device or a device group, thus allowing the reporting of
any possible changes to the benefit-risk profile of the medical
device(s), considering new or emerging information in the context of
cumulative information on benefits and risks. Manufacturers should
present this information to identify any safety and performance
concerns, through both reactive and proactive PMS data collection. When
concerns have been identified this gathered information should be used
to re-evaluate the benefit-risk profile and the state of the art of the
medical device(s). When there is evidence of an adverse change to the
benefit-risk profile of the medical device(s), this information should
be evaluated and considered in line with the clinical evaluation and
Risk Management. In the event of such circumstances, there should be
clear consideration and evaluation as to whether the medical device
remains safe and effective (see also section 2.2.2). In line with the
objectives of the MDR, the PSUR should provide transparency of all Post
Market Surveillance data to the Notified Body involved in the conformity
assessment of the device and to the Competent Authorities. The PSUR
should summarize the results and conclusions of the analysis of the data
that the manufacturer has systematically and actively gathered in
post-market surveillance with its device(s) and, where relevant, with
similar devices.
2.1.2 Information on Preventive or Corrective Actions (CAPA) according
to Article 83(4) The PSUR may also be the tool to provide information
about Corrective Action(s) or Preventive Action(s) (CAPA) which are
covered by Article 83(4) first sentence and for which the information of
the competent authorities and, when applicable, the notified body about
these CAPAs and their implementation is required6. The actions referred
to in Article 83(4) 6
"If, in the course of the post-market surveillance, a need for
preventive or corrective action or both is identified, the manufacturer
shall implement the appropriate measures and inform the competent
authorities concerned and, where applicable, the notified body", Article
83(4) first sentence.
Page 6 of 40
Medical Devices Medical Device Coordination Group Document
MDCG 2022-21
second sentence i.e. serious incidents and field safety corrective
actions, are intended to be reported through EUDAMED. The scope of the
various types of CAPAs under Article 83(4) does not cover quality
management system related CAPA's unless these could have a direct impact
on product safety, performance or quality. These CAPA can be related to:

Devices already placed on the EU market.

Issues that might have a direct impact on the product and that might
impact product safety, performance or quality and,

Any action related to a voluntary and non-temporary suspension of
marketing of the device by the manufacturer which is not related to a
commercial decision.

Evaluation of benefits and risks identified through post-market
activities as described in Annex III, point 1 (a) of MDR, i.e. in
particular: o
records referring to non-serious incidents and data on any undesirable
sideeffects;
o
relevant specialist or technical literature, databases and/or registers;
o
information, including feedbacks and complaints, provided by users,
distributors and importers and,
o
publicly available information about similar medical devices.
A summary of all the above Article 83(4) first sentence CAPA can be made
available to the Competent Authorities either through the PSUR or
through a specific report. However, all safety related CAPA should be
part of the PSUR (see section 2.2).
2.2 PSUR content 2.2.1 General aspects For the purpose of the PSUR
guidance, the term "device" relates to a device model and not to an
"individual" device, as "individual" devices are placed on the market at
different moments during the period covered by the "device" certificate.
Per Article 86(1) and Annex III, point 2 of the MDR, the PSUR is part of
the technical documentation on post-market surveillance to be drawn up
by the manufacturer in accordance with Articles 83 to 86. The PSUR
should be presented in a clear, organized, readily searchable and
unambiguous manner. The PSUR should be generated as a stand-alone
document that can be assessed independently from the supporting
documentation. The PSUR should provide a general overview of all
post-market surveillance activities and the data collected and analysed
based on the PMS plan for the device. Therefore, the aim of the PSUR is
not to duplicate all data and reports generated by the PMS Plan but to
summarize all results and conclusions. Page 7 of 40
Medical Devices Medical Device Coordination Group Document
MDCG 2022-21
The manufacturer should specify the relevant information and sections of
the different reports and provide a summary of the data collected, their
assessment and conclusion as well as the actions taken when appropriate.
If a manufacturer decides that specific datasets are not used or deemed
not to be required, the manufacturer should duly justify why these
datasets are not included in the PSUR. It is recommended to add an
executive summary in particular as regards the main relevant information
related to benefits and risks and to the changes in the acceptability of
the benefitrisk profile. To the extent possible, a similar presentation
of the PSUR should be followed regardless of the device class. A
recommended template for the PSUR is provided in Annex I of this
guidance.
2.2.2 Specific aspects In accordance with Article 86(1) MDR, the PSUR
should summarize the results and conclusions of the analysis of the
post-market surveillance data gathered as a result of the PMS Plan and
provide: 
the conclusions of the benefit-risk determination7;

the main findings of the Post-Market Clinical Follow-up (PMCF);

the volume of sales of the device and an estimate evaluation of the size
and other characteristics of the population using the device and, when
practicable, the usage frequency of the device.
In order to prepare the above summary, the following elements should be
considered: 
Information concerning serious incidents and field safety corrective
actions;

records referring to non-serious incidents and data on any undesirable
sideeffects;

information from trend reporting;

relevant specialist or technical literature, databases and/or registers;

information, including feedbacks and complaints, provided by users,
distributors and importers;

publicly available information about similar medical devices.
More detailed information on (i) the collection of the relevant data and
(ii) their presentation and evaluation are provided respectively in
Annex I and Annex III of this guidance.

3 Scope and duration of the PSUR requirement 3.1 Scope of the PSUR
requirement 3.1.1 Devices within the scope of PSUR requirement Article
86 requires manufacturers of class III, class IIb and class IIa devices
to "prepare a Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) for each device and
when relevant, for each category or group of devices". 

MDR compliant devices o
Class IIa, class IIb and class III devices certified according to the
requirements of the MDR placed on the market or put into service either
before or after the MDR Date of Application, 26 May 2021 (DoA);
o
Custom-made devices falling within class IIa, class IIb and class III
complying with the requirements of the MDR;
o
Annex XVI devices falling within class IIa, IIb and class III devices,
once the MDR becomes applicable to those devices;
"Legacy devices"
Taking into account that the term "device" in this guidance relates to a
device model and not to an "individual" device (see section 2.2.1.) and
that "individual" devices may have been placed on the market both before
and after MDR DoA based on Article 120(3) regime, the scope of "legacy
devices" covers all the devices for which at least some individual
devices have been placed on the market before MDR DoA.
3.1.2 Devices outside the scope of PSUR requirement 
Class I MDR devices and class I legacy devices.

"Old devices": the scope of "old devices" covers only the devices for
which no individual devices have been placed on the market from MDR DoA.
3.2 Duration of the PSUR requirement 3.2.1 Device lifetime A PSUR is
required throughout the lifetime of the device: The lifetime of a device
is the time period specified by the manufacturer in the device
documentation during which the device is expected to remain safe and
effective for use / in use. If the lifetime exceeds the administrative
provisions in Annexes IX, X, XI, XIII of MDR, i.e. max 10 years for
nonimplantable devices and max 15 years for implantable devices, then
the shorter timeline between the lifetime of the device and the
retention period should prevail.
3.2.2 End of obligation to update the PSUR Determination of the end of
the PSUR requirement:
Page 9 of 40
Medical Devices Medical Device Coordination Group Document
MDCG 2022-21
A PSUR is no longer required to be updated when the last manufactured
device of the device model has been placed on the market and the
intended lifetime of that (individual) device; i.e. the overall lifetime
of the device (model), has been achieved. The overall lifetime of a
device (model) should include the time between the placing on the market
of the last manufactured device and the end of the intended lifetime of
that (individual) device. Example 1: A single-use device may have an
intended lifetime shorter than its shelf-life. After the placing on the
market of the last device of the final production cycle, the PSUR can be
terminated when the end of the shelf-life plus intended lifetime has
been reached. Example 2: An X-ray machine may have no shelf-life but
should have a lifetime determined by its continuation to perform and
remain safe as intended. A PSUR is required until the end of the
intended lifetime of the last device placed on the market. Example 3: An
implantable device may have a shelf-life of 3 years but an intended
lifetime of 10 years. After the last device produced has been placed on
the market, the PSUR can be terminated when the shelf-life (3 years)
plus the intended lifetime (10 years), i.e. 13 years, has passed. When a
device's certificate has expired and the lifetime of the device has not
yet been covered by the last PSUR, a PSUR should continue to be made
available, upon request, to the competent authorities. When the placing
of the device on the market has been discontinued by the manufacturer
while the device's certificate has not yet expired, a PSUR should
continue to be made available to the notified body involved in the
conformity assessment and, upon request, to competent authorities. In
the two above cases, the PSUR should at least include reactive data
regarding product complaints, reporting of serious incidents, FSCA and
trend reports as documented in the system used to record the data and
relevant data from literature research and relevant databases. A
workflow to determine whether a PSUR is required or not is provided with

entire claimed lifetime is then coverer ed. c :Class III and Implantable
MDR devices.
4 Grouping of devices A PSUR should be drawn up per device and, where
relevant, for a category or group of devices. If it covers a single
device, it should be understood as the device associated with one Basic
UDI-DI (or one device for legacy devices). Every device may include
different variants or sizes. According to Article 86(1), a same PSUR may
cover a "category or group of devices". As a consequence, multiple Basic
UDI-DIs (or device families) may be covered in one PSUR. Nevertheless
the manufacturer should demonstrate the relevance of the grouping of
several devices within the same PSUR by providing a justification.
Page 11 of 40
Medical Devices Medical Device Coordination Group Document
MDCG 2022-21
4.1 General aspects for all PSURs  In case a PSUR includes several
Basic UDI-DIs, the data should be presented in a clear, organized manner
so that it is easy to determine how each device performs independently.
 In case of a group of devices covered by the same PSUR, the
manufacturer should assign a "leading device" which drives the schedule
of that PSUR. The "leading device" needs to be the highest risk class or
one of the highest risk class.  The "leading device" determines the
schedule applicable to the whole group of devices (data collection
period covered, PSUR frequency, issuance timeline, PSUR reporting
through EUDAMED or not).  Therefore, for the other devices, these
requirements should be aligned on the "leading device", irrespective of
their device class or certification date.  When a device grouping has
been established, it could be amended for the PSUR update(s) by removing
or adding devices except for the "leading device" which cannot be
changed.  In case of a change related to the "leading device" (new
device model /change of the Basic UDI DI), a new PSUR should then be
issued.  PSUR updates for the group of devices which includes the
former "leading device" should continue in parallel independently it
continues or not to be placed on the market.  Due to the involvement of
only one Notified Body for the review or evaluation of a PSUR, the
grouping of devices within one PSUR is only possible for devices for
which the conformity assessment activities have been carried out by the
same Notified Body.  In case a device or, where applicable, the leading
device, is on the market with subsequent certificates of different
notified bodies, the revision history provided should make a reference
to the previous PSUR versions where the former Notified Body(ies) were
involved and, when applicable, indicates the actions required or taken
by previous Notified Body(ies).
4.2 Specific aspects for PSURs to be submitted in EUDAMED  At least one
Basic UDI-DI of class III or implantable devices needs to be referenced
within a PSUR. A manufacturer can add several Basic UDI-DIs in case of
grouping of devices.  For the purpose of EUDAMED, every class III or
implantable device should have at least one linked PSUR.  For a same
reporting period, a Basic UDI-DI can be referenced only in one PSUR as
"leading device" but can be referenced in other PSURs provided this
device is non-leading in those PSURs. Page 12 of 40
Medical Devices Medical Device Coordination Group Document
MDCG 2022-21
 When registering a PSUR in EUDAMED, the manufacturer should capture
the Basic UDI-DIs of the class III or implantable devices belonging to
the group via the EUDAMED web interface (see PSUR Web form in Annex V of
this guidance).  If the PSUR contains devices which are not Class III
or implantable devices, as these devices do not require a PSUR in
EUDAMED, the manufacturer should not capture them via the Web interface
but list them in the body of the PSUR report as part of the PSUR scope.
 If the PSUR contains class III or implantable legacy devices, as these
devices do not require8 a PSUR in EUDAMED, the manufacturer should not
capture them via the web interface but list them in the body of the PSUR
report as part of the PSUR scope.
5 PSUR preparation and issuance The manufacturer is responsible for
preparing and updating the PSURs and making them part of the technical
documentation as specified in Annex III of the MDR and in Annex XIII for
custom-made devices (CMD).
5.1 Data collection period, issuance timeline, submission and schedule
of PSURs The data collection period should start at the device MDR
certification date. If the device is not MDR-certified, the data
collection period starts at MDR Date of Application (26 May 2021). Note
1: for the first PSUR, the data analysis may be supported by the
device's historical data collected through the Post Market Surveillance
activities as they were conducted prior to Date of Application or MDR
Device Certification date (see section 5.2.2.1). Note 2: The first PSUR
may not cover an exact data collection period of 12 or 24 months. The
first PSUR update(s) may then cover a period different than 12 or 24
months of postmarket data to allow for data collection periods being
contiguous to avoid any gap or overlap of data, i.e. the end of data
collection period for one PSUR marks the start date of the next PSUR's
data collection period. 
PSUR preparation and issuance timeline
The PSUR preparation and issuance timeline refers to the period required
for the manufacturer to prepare and submit or make available the PSUR
after the end of the data collection period. 
PSUR submission / issuance
Depending on the class of the device and in accordance with Article
86(2), the manufacturer should either submit the PSUR to the Notified
Body via EUDAMED or make it available to the Notified Body involved in
the conformity assessment. 8
See MDCG guidance 2021-25 - Application of MDR requirements to 'legacy
devices' and to devices placed on the market prior to 26 May 2021
Page 13 of 40
Medical Devices Medical Device Coordination Group Document
MDCG 2022-21
For those PSUR requiring submission through EUDAMED, the submission
should occur with due diligence after the end of the issuance timeline
(see section 5.2.1). Schedule for PSUR updates 
The schedule is the generated cycle for (i) the start and the end of the
data collection period covered by each PSUR and (ii) preparing and
submitting the PSUR or making it available after the end of the data
collection period.
Continuity of the schedule when a legacy device becomes MDR certified 

When an MDD compliant device becomes certified under the MDR without
significant change in the sense of Art 120(3), the initial PSUR schedule
established under the Article 120(3) regime may continue (unless
otherwise agreed between the manufacturer and its Notified Body).
Therefore, the schedule for the MDR device may not align on the initial
MDR certification date. When a significant change in the sense of
Article 120(3) occurs, the device should be considered as a new device.
Based on the MDR certification date of this device, a new schedule needs
to be started (unless otherwise agreed between the manufacturer and its
Notified Body).
5.2 Main scenarios Several scenarios should be considered depending on
(i) the device has been directly MDR certified or (ii) is a legacy
device which has become MDR certified during the transition period or
(iii) is a legacy device which would remain an AIMDD or MDD device until
the end of the transition period.
5.2.1 New Devices certified under MDR (not previously marketed or put
into service under AIMDD 90/385/EEC & MDD 90/42/EEC) The requirement to
issue a PSUR applies from the date the device has been certified under
MDR (see definition of "device certification date" in section 1.2). Data
collection period The starting point for the data collection period is
based on the first device certification date for the MDR device. The end
of the data collection period of the PSUR should be aligned to the
anniversary date of the issued MDR certificate or in agreed schedule
with the Notified Body. The defined schedule for PSUR updates should
continue as planned for any future recertification and remain aligned to
first certificate issued under the MDR. In exceptional circumstances,
this date may be changed on alignment between the Notified Body and the
manufacturer and this change should be justified by the manufacturer in
the first available PSUR. The data collection periods should be
contiguous: this may lead to a shorter or longer data collection period
covered by the next PSUR which results from these exceptional
circumstances. Page 14 of 40
Medical Devices Medical Device Coordination Group Document
MDCG 2022-21
PSUR preparation and issuance / submission 
For class III devices or implantable devices
Manufacturers should submit PSURs through EUDAMED to the Notified Body
involved in the conformity assessment. The PSUR should be submitted in
EUDAMED from the end of the data collection period. 
For non-implantable devices of either class IIa or class IIb
The PSUR is not submitted to EUDAMED: manufacturers should make PSURs
available to the Notified Body involved in the conformity assessment
and, upon request, to the Competent Authorities.
5.2.2 Legacy devices which become certified under MDR during the
transition period (previously marketed or put into service under AIMDD
90/385/EEC or MDD 93/42/EEC) It should be noted that "legacy devices"
are subject to the requirements laid down in Article 86 based on their
classification in accordance with the MDD. A possible change of their
risk class under the MDR should not be taken into account during the
transition period. Active implantable devices subject to the AIMDD
should be considered as class III devices for the purpose of applying
the PSUR requirement during the transition period9. For "legacy
devices", manufacturers should not submit the PSUR in EUDAMED but make
it available upon request to the Competent Authorities and the Notified
Body.
5.2.2.1An initial PSUR has not been issued for the MDD compliant device
Specific considerations are listed below: 
When a "legacy device" becomes certified under the MDR and no PSUR has
been issued by the time of certification (e.g. the MDR certification
occurs within the first (second) year after MDR DoA), the PSUR should be
prepared at the anniversary date of the MDR certification (or issuance
date of the Declaration of Conformity (DoC)) or in alignment with the
Notified Body.

When relevant and for the first PSUR for the MDR device, it is
recommended that the data analysis be supported by the device's
"historical data" collected through the Post Market Surveillance
activities conducted prior to the Date of Application or MDR Device
Certification date. The "historical data" may be presented in a
different format than the MDR ones and could be limited to a summary.
9
See section III.1 last bullet point of MDCG guidance 2021-25 on
application of MDR requirements to 'legacy devices' and to devices
placed on the market prior to 26 May 2021
Page 15 of 40
Medical Devices Medical Device Coordination Group Document
MDCG 2022-21
5.2.2.2An initial PSUR was issued for the legacy device before it
becomes MDR certified Data collection period - First PSUR The data
collection period for the MDR certified device should start at the end
of data collection period for the PSUR drawn up for a "legacy device" in
accordance with Article 120(3) MDR. There is no need to consider the
data before MDR date of application since a PSUR for the corresponding
legacy device has already been issued.
5.2.3 Legacy devices which do not become MDR certified during the
transition period Manufacturers should follow the rules corresponding to
the class of the valid MDD certificate. It should be noted that the
Notified Body10 which provided the certification of legacy devices under
MDD or AIMDD remains responsible for the appropriate surveillance until
the end of the transition period or the withdrawal of the MDD or AIMDD
certificate if it occurs before the end of the transition period. Data
collection period The data collection period for the first PSUR should
start at the MDR DoA. However, when relevant and for the first PSUR, it
is recommended that the analysis be supported by the device's historical
data collected through the Post Market Surveillance activities as they
were conducted prior to the MDR DoA. The data related to time periods
prior to MDR DoA may be presented in a different format and could be
limited to a summary. PSUR issuance / submission Manufacturers should
not submit the PSUR in EUDAMED but make PSURs available upon request to
Competent Authorities and the Notified Body.
5.3 Specific provisions for custom-made devices 
The preparation of the PSUR is only required for classes IIa, IIb and
class III custommade devices complying with the requirements of the MDR,
per schedule in accordance with device class as described in Article 86
and in accordance with guidance MDCG 2021-3 for custom-made devices11.

All custom-made devices which have been put on the market from MDR DoA
are MDR devices: therefore no legacy devices need to be considered.

Answers on Custom-Made Devices"
Page 16 of 40
Medical Devices Medical Device Coordination Group Document
MDCG 2022-21

For new MDR devices, the first PSUR should be prepared within one (class
IIb and III) or two (class IIa devices) year(s) following the first
Statement of Conformity for this type of devices is issued. For these
devices, the PSUR is not submitted to EUDAMED but it should be made
available to the Competent Authorities upon request.

The PSUR may cover entire groups or families of custom-made devices
(e.g., hips, knees, shoulders, extremities). A justification should
always be provided by the manufacturer for the grouping of several
devices and device families within the same PSUR.

In case of Class III implantable custom-made devices, PSURs are not
required to be sent to notified bodies but should be part of the
documentation (see MDCG 2021-3) according to Section 2 of Annex XIII of
the MDR.
A summary table of the applicable requirements for the various device
classes for MDR devices and legacy devices is provided in Annex IV of
this guidance. Decision trees based on section 5 are provided within
figures 2 and 3.

ANNEXES ANNEX I: Template for the PSUR The PSUR should be generated as a
stand-alone document that can be assessed independently from the
supporting documentation. The PSUR should provide a general overview of
all post-market surveillance activities and the data collected and
analysed based on the PMS plan for the device. Therefore, the aim of the
PSUR is not to duplicate all data and reports generated by the PMS Plan
but it should summarize all results and conclusions. The manufacturer
should specify the relevant information and sections of the different
reports and provide a summary of the data collected, their assessment
and conclusion as well as any actions taken when appropriate. If a
manufacturer decides that specific data sets are not used or deemed to
be not required, the manufacturer should duly justify the absence of the
data sets not included in the relevant sections of the PSUR. It is
recommended to add an executive summary in particular as regards the
main relevant information related to benefits and risks and to the
changes in the acceptability of the benefitrisk profile. PSUR cover page
The PSUR cover page includes the relevant data to allow distinguishing
between the various PSUR updates. For those PSURs submitted to EUDAMED,
the PSUR form (EUDAMED Web form, see Annex V) can be considered as a
cover page. A Table of Contents should also be present for all PSURs.
The cover page should at least include the following information: 
Manufacturer information

Medical device(s) covered by the PSUR

Notified body name and organization number;

PSUR reference number assigned by the manufacturer*;

Version number of the PSUR;

The data collection period covered by the PSUR;

Table of contents.
Executive summary When an executive summary is produced, it should
provide a brief overview of the PSUR content and an overall conclusion
in relation to the benefit-risk determination. It should include the
following information: 
A brief description and status of actions taken by the manufacturer
based on the previous PSUR;
Page 21 of 40
Medical Devices Medical Device Coordination Group Document
MDCG 2022-21

A brief description and status of actions taken by the Notified Body as
part of the review of the previous PSUR;

In case the data collection period is changed by the manufacturer, a
justification should be provided, and a statement should be provided
whether the change affects the comparability of the results gained;

Once the conclusions of the PSUR have been completed, the main results
of the current PSUR should include a clear and bold statement declaring
whether the benefit-risk profile has been impacted, negatively or
positively or remains unchanged, based on the information reported
within the current PSUR. The statement could be a simple expression, for
example "Based on the analysis of the collected data, it is concluded
that the benefit-risk profile of the device(s) has not been (or has
been) adversely impacted / remains unchanged".
Description of the devices covered by the PSUR and their intended uses
(Article 86.1) This section is intended to provide an overview of the
devices covered by the PSUR and the possible changes to its scope. The
added and removed devices should be clearly identified. The following
information should be included for the devices covered by the PSUR: 
Device Classification (risk class of device) in accordance with the
applicable classification rules.

Date from one of the following: first declaration of conformity, first
EC / EU Certificate issued, first date device CE-marked, first placed on
the market, first put into service, if software, date first made
available.

Status of the device(s): on the market, no longer placed on the market,
recalled, field safety corrective action initiated.

The intended purpose of the device(s) as per the Instructions for Use
according to Annex I, Chapter III, 23.4(b) MDR, any indications,
contra-indications, and target populations.
-
For MDR Devices o The information shall be broken down by the Basic
UDI-DI(s) and explain any device changes within each Basic UDI-DI
compared to the previous PSUR to comprehend possible changes in results
compared to the previous PSURs. o
-
For Legacy Devices o The information shall be broken down by device
group/family of devices o
-
Provide the device trade name(s) associated to the corresponding Basic
UDIDI(s) and the European Medical Device Nomenclature (EMDN).
Provide device trade name(s) (this includes all trade names the device
may have on the market in different Member States) and European Medical
device Nomenclature (EMDN).
For Custom-Made Devices (MDR) o Provide the required information by
device group.
Grouping of the Devices Information regarding the grouping of devices
are provided in section 4 of this guidance. 
The manufacturer should justify the grouping of the devices in one PSUR.
Page 22 of 40
Medical Devices Medical Device Coordination Group Document
MDCG 2022-21

The justification could be based on the benefits to report multiple
devices in one PSUR or alternatively the disadvantages to report each
device in separate PSURs.

In case the group of devices is changed, a justification for the change
should be provided. The manufacturer should also provide the PSUR
reference number of the PSUR where the data of the removed device(s) are
reported.

The manufacturer should define the "leading device" according to which
the PSUR schedule is determined.

The PSUR reference number is attached to the "leading device" and should
remain unchanged for the PSUR updates, provided the "leading device"
within the grouped devices has remained the same.
Volume of Sales (Article 86.1) 
The manufacturer should consider all the devices placed on the market.
This could be volumes of sales, units shipped, or units implanted or
another suitable indicator. Whichever method is used should be
consistent throughout the PSUR in all areas to allow for a comparison of
data. Provide accurate information the number of devices sold. The data
should be presented by year to year (see Annex II, Table 1).

Provide further information on the volume of sales in respect to the
various sizes, models and configurations of the device as deemed
necessary.

Indicate to what criteria the number of devices on the market is
provided: o
Devices placed on the market or put into service;
o
Units distributed within each time period;
o
Number of episodes of use (for reusable devices);
o
Active installed base;
o
Units distributed from the date of declaration of conformity or EC/EU
mark approval to the end date of each time period;
o
Number of devices implanted;
o
Other -- description/rational should be provided.
Size and other characteristics of the population using the device
(Article 86.1) 
Evaluate how many patients have been exposed to the device and the
characteristics of the exposed patient group(s).

Estimate the number of patients exposed, as the sales numbers alone do
not necessarily reflect the number of uses of the device (usage
frequency). There are different scenarios as: Active devices may have a
lifetime of several years with multiple uses each day, resulting in high
number of patients exposed to the device (e.g. CTs). In case of
implants, multiple devices may be used in one patient, e.g. several bone
screws in one surgery. For other devices, the sales numbers directly
correlate with the patient number exposed to the device.

Describe the usage of the device in different patient populations and
when available compare it to the expected usage and identify the
possible over-represented or Page 23 of 40
Medical Devices Medical Device Coordination Group Document
MDCG 2022-21
under-represented patient groups if clinically relevant and known by the
manufacturer. 
When possible, consideration should be given to patient demographic
aspects.

When applicable, evaluate the effect of the detected changes to findings
obtained previously and in the current PSUR.
Post-Market Surveillance : Vigilance and CAPA information Background
information should be gathered prior to the current PSUR and may
include, for example, the achieved safety and performance of the device,
information related to intended benefits achieved or not and description
of new risks or emerging trends reported in earlier PSURs. Vigilance
data consist of information concerning serious incidents, field safety
corrective actions (FSCAs) and trend reports. The data could be
presented in tables, figures and/or in text format. The aim of the data
presentation is to provide an accurate summary and appraisal of the
Vigilance data (Article 87 and Article 88 MDR) and CAPA data (Article
83(4) and Article 86 MDR) for the reported data collection period and to
compare with the same types of data from the previous PSURs. The data
should be presented by the device (Basic UDI-DI), device group (CMD) or
device group/family level (legacy devices). When justified, the data can
be presented for combinations of devices, for example, a device and its
accessory. a) Information concerning Serious Incidents (Article 87,
Annex III MDR) 
The aim is to present the serious incidents and their impact on the
overall device safety. This section should characterize the data from at
least three different perspectives: the device problems, the root cause
and the health effects on the person(s) affected. In addition to the
data, provide a summary text regarding any new types of serious
incidents which have occurred since the last report.

Data regarding serious incidents should be reported using the IMDRF
Adverse Event Terminology (AET)13, when available. With regard to the
historical data, the usage of the IMDRF Adverse Event Terminology is not
required. o
The usages of the Level 2 terms/codes are considered sufficient to
enable the grouping of the serious incidents;
o
Report both the codes and the terms.

When applicable report both absolute figures and rate of the serious
incidents and split the data by region (EEA+TR+XI) and worldwide.

Examples of the data presentation are shared in Annex II of this
guidance. o The most frequent medical device problems by IMDRF Adverse
Event Terminology Annex A -- "Medical Device Problem", by year to year-
(see Annex II, Table 4). o The most common investigation findings as
part of the completed "cause investigation" of the serious incidents by
IMDRF Adverse Event Terminology Annex C -- "Investigation Findings",
(see Annex II, Table 5).

MDCG 2022-21
o The health impacts on the person affected as a consequence of the
medical device serious incident by IMDRF Adverse Event Terminology Annex
F -- "Health Impact", including the term and code. It could also be used
for the 4year summary data (starting as of the device MDR certification
date or the MDR date of application for legacy devices) and split the
data by the IMDRF Adverse Event Terminology Annex D -- "Investigation
Conclusion" (including term and code). Use only the most relevant
investigation conclusion terms/codes which are related to the detected
health impacts. Report the most common health impacts as well as any
cases resulting into death, regardless if they are included in the most
common health impacts. In addition, split the data by region (see Annex
II, Table 6). b) Information from Trend Reporting (Article 88, Annex III
MDR, non-serious incidents and expected undesirable side effects) The
data related to the trend reports will be detailed after the adoption of
the MDCG guidance on trend reporting. c) Information from Field Safety
Corrective Actions (FSCA) (Article 87, Annex II MDR) 
Provide a summary of the FSCAs for the period of the PSUR and compare
with the information from the previous PSURs.

The summary should include the following information14: o types of
actions. o issuing date, o scope of the FSCA, o status of the FSCA at
the time of the PSUR, o manufacturer's reference number, o a brief
description of the reason for action and description of action and
impacted regions.

guidance (table 7). d) Preventive and / or Corrective Actions (CAPA)
(Article 83.4 and Article 86 MDR) 
Provide a list of all preventive and / or corrective actions (CAPA)
according to Article 83(4) and to Article 86.

The following information should be provided for each CAPA: o o o o o o
o
the type of action, initiation date, scope of the CAPA, status of the
action, manufacturer's reference number, CAPA description, the root
cause (internal codes with the explanation, IMDRF terms/codes or free
text), o effectiveness of the CAPA An example of the data presentation
is presented in Annex II of this guidance (table 8).

6.2(a) and (f) MDR) The data that should be reported in this section
consist of other PMS datasets not referred to above and are generated by
general methods and procedures of PMCF (Annexes III, Annex XIV Part B,
6.2 (a) and (f) MDR). The sections below should be completed in
alignment with the PMS and PMCF plans. A list of collected data from
other sources of clinical data in the post-market phase should be
provided. Safety and performance data generated from these activities
should be used also for comparison to other similar devices with the
same intended purpose. a) Feedbacks and complaints from users,
distributors and importers 
All feedback from users, distributors and importers and complaints not
reported in the Vigilance section above should be considered in this
section. The most common complaints should be presented within this
section of the PSUR with the following considerations: o Grouping of
complaints by IMDRF Adverse Event Terminology Annex A -- "Medical Device
Problem" (including the term and code) or internal event codes including
term; o Occurence rate (including reference chosen); o Justification for
inclusion of these groups of complaints and exclusion of those not
presented; o Information whether the presented complaints have led to
initiation of preventive and / or corrective actions (CAPA).
b) Scientific Literature Review of relevant specialist or technical
literature o
For detailed information about literature searches conducted and results
generated, the manufacturer may refer to the technical documentation.
c) Public Databases and /or Registry Data o
Provide a list of all registries reviewed including the following
information: the name or registry reference, type of registry
(Prospective or Retrospective data collection);
o
Provide a list of findings in comparison to the devices with same
intended use and justify any identified differences. Provide information
about any new risks identified from this data set.
d) Publicly Available Information about Similar Medical Devices o
Additional publicly available information may include information
gathered from other manufacturers of similar medical devices, (e.g.
results of a manufacturer's specific PMCF study made publicly available
in the manufacturer's Summary of Safety and Clinical Performance (SSCP),
Cochrane Library or other libraries);
o
The type and location of this information should be provided, and when
possible a comparison of the devices with same intended purpose should
be evaluated with any possible differences in safety and performance
reported.
e) Other Data Sources
Page 26 of 40
Medical Devices Medical Device Coordination Group Document
MDCG 2022-21
o
The other used data sources could be for example real-world data from
electronic health records and digital health-monitoring devices;
o
Provide a list of the used data sources and findings with specific
reference to safety and performance of the device.
Specific Post-Market Clinical Follow-up (PMCF) Information (Article 86,
MDR Annex XIV, Part B, 6.2(b)) This section should include a summary of
the findings generated from the analysis of specific PMCF activities
performed by the manufacturer as defined in Annex XIV, Part B, 6.2(b).
This section is not limited to PMCF studies and should include other
specific PMCF activities conducted by the manufacturer. For this
section, the manufacturer should refer to the main findings of the PMCF
and, when available, to the conclusions documented in the PMCF
Evaluation Report to allow for a comprehensive assessment of the
specific PMCF activities it has performed. Summary of Findings and
Conclusions of the PSUR In this section of the PSUR, the manufacturer
should consider the validity of the collected data taking into
consideration any deficiencies or bias, and provide a conclusion on the
benefits and risks of the device from the gathered data. In the case
when these data have had any impact on the overall benefit-risk
determination, this should be described. The manufacturer should also
outline all actions that have been taken as a result of the analysis of
data collected since the last PSUR. a) Validity of the collected data o
The manufacturer should identify any limitations to the data that have
been collected, this could include for example reduced sales or usage of
the device, known bias from feedback obtained or enrolment into a PMCF
study.
o
The manufacturer should consider whether these limitations impact the
ability to formulate meaningful conclusions and whether an impact
assessment of the overall benefit-risk profile is still possible.
b) Overall conclusions from the analysis of the collected data o
The manufacturer should outline any new or emerging risks identified or
when common occurrences of poor performance or claimed benefits have not
been achieved within the current reporting period. When there are new or
emerging risks that have been identified, the manufacturer should
consider any specific patient groups, device models, accessories used,
geographical regions impacted, duration of risk etc. Specific
information should be provided on the seriousness and the full potential
clinical impact of these risks.
o
The manufacturer may also describe any new benefits that have been
identified from the reporting period.
o
The manufacturer should formulate evidence-based conclusions to
determine whether the benefit-risk profile of the device has changed or
not.
o
Finally, within the conclusion, the manufacturer should declare whether
there has been an adverse impact on the benefit-risk profile of the
device or the benefit-risk profile remains unchanged.

ANNEX III: General Information Related to the Presentation and
Assessment of the Collected Data by the Manufacturer 1. How Data Should
be presented 
Each dataset specified in the PMS Plan should be presented and analysed
individually. A summary providing the used datasets including the PMCF
data should highlight the limitations related to the collected data.

Datasets should be split by Basic UDI-DI or model of the device if the
Basic UDI-DI does not exist.

If the group of devices or the devices within a Basic UDI-DI(s) have
changed then it is necessary to report separately the data with former
and later combination of devices.

The data should be split by region, when applicable. The used regions
are EEA, TR, XI and worldwide. Worldwide data include data from EEA, TR
and XI.

Each PSUR should contain data from the data collection period of this
PSUR compared with the same types of data from the previous PSUR periods
(see tables 2 to 5 of Annex II of this guidance).

The first PSUR data collection is not retrospective (does not go before
the date of application of the MDR) except when no PSUR has been issued
for the corresponding MDD compliant device: it is then recommended that
the "historical data" collected before the MDR DoA be considered for the
first PSUR of the MDR compliant device (see section 5.2.2.1).

Data should be reported by year to year: o
Class III and Class IIb: Reporting Day+ preceding 12 months (N); N -- 12
months (N2); N2-12 months (N3); N3-12 months (N4)
o
Class IIa: Reporting Day+ preceding 24 months (N); N -- 24 months (N2)

The manufacturer should present the data utilizing the International
Medical Device Regulators Forum (IMDRF) Adverse Event Terminology when
the content of the data facilitates it.

The following IMDRF Adverse Event Terminologies, terms and codes should
at least be utilized:  Annex A: Medical Device Problem 
Annex C: Cause Investigation - Investigation Findings

Annex D: Cause Investigation - Investigation Conclusion

Annex F: Health Effects - Health Impact
o
Level 2 terms are satisfactory to enable the grouping of cases.
o
When the Level 2 terms are not available, manufacturers can use Level 1
terms/codes. Page 32 of 40
Medical Devices Medical Device Coordination Group Document
MDCG 2022-21
2. How Data Should be assessed by the manufacturer 
Findings from all datasets should be considered and evaluated by
comparing data from the various sources and identifying possible
conflicting results.

The manufacturer should assess the results considering the different
patient populations, sizes and models of the device, device combination
or variants. When applicable, the manufacturer should evaluate the
findings in relation to the state of the art.

The manufacturer should assess the data in relation to the thresholds
concerning known risks and side effects and benefits intended to be
gained.

The manufacturer should identify factors that support or refute
previously identified safety and performance concerns as well as
evidence relating to new safety signals or emerging risks.

The manufacturer may also describe any new benefits that have been
identified from the reporting period and benefits not achieved as
intended.

When applicable, the IMDRF Terminologies for Categorized Adverse Event
Reporting should be used in the analysis.

If the device is used in a combination of devices, the analysis should
identify the role of each device in comparison to other devices or
accessories used together.

The performance and safety of the device should be compared to other
devices with the same intended use.

Introduction
Safety reporting in clinical investigations of medical devices shall be
performed in line with the requirements of the Regulation (EU) 2017/745
-- Medical Device Regulation (MDR) Article 80(2): The sponsor shall
report, without delay to all Member States in which the clinical
investigation is being conducted, all of the following by means of the
electronic system referred to in MDR Article 73: a) any serious adverse
event that has a causal relationship with the investigational device,
the comparator or the investigation procedure or where such causal
relationship is reasonably possible; b) any device deficiency that might
have led to a serious adverse event if appropriate action had not been
taken, intervention had not occurred, or circumstances had been less
fortunate; c) any new findings in relation to any event referred to in
points a) and b). The period for reporting shall take account of the
severity of the event. Where necessary to ensure timely reporting, the
sponsor may submit an initial report that is incomplete followed up by a
complete report. Upon request by any Member State in which the clinical
investigation is being conducted, the sponsor shall provide all
information referred to in paragraph 1. For post-market clinical follow
up (PMCF) investigations of CE-marked devices1 used within the intended
use covered by the CE-marking, reporting requirements of MDR Article
80(5) and (6) apply. This means that the vigilance provisions laid down
in Articles 87 to 90 and in the acts adopted pursuant to Article 91
shall apply for PMCF clinical investigations. However, this guidance
document is still relevant for PMCF clinical investigations as the
reporting of serious adverse events where a causal relationship to the
preceding investigational procedure has been established shall follow
the reporting procedures of clinical investigations as outlined in
Article 80.
1.1 Safety reporting in the absence of Eudamed Since the electronic
system referred to in Article 73 (Eudamed) will not be available and
fully functional at the Date of application of the MDR this guidance
outlines the procedures for safety reporting in clinical investigations
in the absence of Eudamed. This document defines Serious Adverse Event
(SAE) reporting modalities and includes a summary tabulation reporting
format.

The PMCF investigations referred to in MDR Article 74(1).
Page 4 of 19
2
Scope
2.1 Clinical investigations of medical devices The reporting modalities
and format set out in this guidance apply to: 
Pre-market clinical investigations covered by Articles 62 and 74(2) of
the MDR conducted with: a) Non-CE marked devices, b) CE marked devices
used outside the intended use(s) covered by the CE-marking. c) The term
pre-market clinical investigation may also include some studies covered
by MDR Article 82. As MDR Article 82 allows member states to define
national requirements for such clinical investigations, sponsors are
encouraged to check with the applicable NCA2 whether this guidance or
other reporting procedures should be applied. In situations where a
clinical investigation has started using a non-CE marked device, and the
right to bear the CE marking has been obtained before the end of the
clinical investigation, the SAE reporting continues until completion of
the investigation, according to the clinical investigation plan and
these guidelines apply throughout the SAE reporting period. For
pre-market clinical investigations involving CE marked comparator
devices used within their intended purpose, SAEs occurring in or to
subjects that are in the comparator arm of an investigation shall also
be reported in accordance with these guidelines. Note: SAEs concerning
CE marked devices which meet the vigilance reporting criteria also need
to be handled under the post-market surveillance/vigilance system.

Those Post-Market Clinical Follow Up (PMCF) investigations that involve
procedures additional to those performed under the normal conditions of
use of the device, and where those additional procedures imposed by the
clinical investigation plan are invasive or burdensome, covered by MDR
Article 74(1). For these clinical investigations the safety reporting
for events pertaining to MDR Article 80(6) follow the Serious Adverse
Event reporting process only, and are outlined in this guidance. Events
pertaining to MDR Article 80(5) are reported following the vigilance
process only and are outside the scope of this guidance.

Note that other post-market clinical investigations may be subject to
safety reporting requirements in line with this guidance due to national
requirements following MDR Article 82, but there is no such general
requirement. Sponsors are encouraged to check with the applicable NCA
whether this guidance or other reporting procedures should be applied.

Due to the transitional provisions in MDR Article 120(11) this guidance
also covers clinical investigations which have started to be conducted
in accordance with Article 10 of Directive 90/385/EEC (AIMDD) or Article
15 of Directive 93/42/EEC (MDD) prior to 26 May 2021. These
investigations may continue to be conducted after date of application of
the MDR, but the reporting of serious adverse events and device
deficiencies shall be carried out in accordance with the MDR
requirements from 26 May 2021 and onwards.
2.2 Medical devices used in clinical trials of medicinal products (drug
trials) 
2
A CE-marked device which is used outside its intended purpose, or a
non-CE marked device in a clinical drug trial would implicitly have to
be assessed for safety and performance and the study shall follow both
MDR (Chapter VI) and the applicable legislation for clinical drug
trials. This guidance document is then relevant for compliance with the
MDR regarding safety reporting.
For the purpose of this guidance," NCAs" encompasses the National
Competent Authorities of the EEA, Switzerland and Turkey.

If a drug-device study (or a drug trial) is not undertaken to assess the
safety or performance of a device used in the study, the reporting
requirements of MDR Article 80 do not apply, as long as the device is CE
marked and used within its intended purpose. This guidance is not
applicable, but the vigilance reporting provisions of MDR apply in those
situations, as for any commercially available device. Sponsors should
make sure that the device manufacturer is notified about any incidents
related to the device and the legal manufacturer of the device is
responsible for the subsequent vigilance reporting.
Definitions
3.1 Investigational device A device that is assessed in a clinical
investigation (MDR Article 2(46)) Note: An investigational device can be
a non-CE marked device or a CE marked device. The definition in MDR
Article 2(46) does not differentiate between different regulatory
statuses of devices. However, the reporting requirements are different
depending on whether the clinical investigation is done for purposes
described in Article 62, 74 or 82. The definition is understood to cover
also the devices investigated in PMCF investigations, even if they are
not subject to notification per Art 74.1.
3.2 Adverse Event (AE) Any untoward medical occurrence, unintended
disease or injury or any untoward clinical signs, including an abnormal
laboratory finding, in subjects, users or other persons, in the context
of a clinical investigation, whether or not related to the
investigational device. (MDR Article 2(57)) Note: a. This definition
includes events that are anticipated as well as unanticipated events b.
This definition includes events occurring in the context of a clinical
investigation related to the investigational device, the comparator or
the procedures3 involved.
3.3 Adverse device effect (ADE) Any adverse event related to the use of
an investigational medical device or a comparator.
3.4 Anticipated serious adverse device effect (ASADE) Any serious
adverse device effect which by its nature, incidence, severity or
outcome has been identified in the last risk assessment document upon
serious adverse device effect occurred.
3.5 Device deficiency (DD) Any inadequacy in the identity, quality,
durability, reliability, safety or performance of an investigational
device, including malfunction, use errors or inadequacy in information
supplied by the manufacturer. (MDR Article 2(59))
3.6 Incident Any malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics or
performance of a device made available on the market, including
use-error due to ergonomic features, as well as any inadequacy in the
information supplied by the manufacturer and any undesirable
side-effect. (MDR Article 2(64))

Reporting method
A new template for the Summary Reporting Form should be used for all
studies from 26 May 2021. The tabular format featured in the Appendix
needs to be filled in/updated for each reportable event or for new
findings/updates to already reported events. It shall be transmitted to
all NCAs where the clinical investigation is being performed. For a new
finding or update, the line of the SAE needs to be updated and the first
column set to "m". Write the new findings in the free description of
event column and highlight the additions. When applicable, update the
others columns as well. For more details on how to complete the form
refer to section 10. Reporting form.
4.1 Transition to reporting via Eudamed Once Eudamed is available and
fully functional the obligations and requirements that relate to
performing safety reporting via Eudamed shall apply from the date
corresponding to six months after the date of publication of the notice
referred to in Article 34(3) of the MDR.
Page 7 of 19
4.1.1 Ongoing events at time of transition to Eudamed It is acknowledged
that at the time of transition to reporting via Eudamed, there will be
ongoing events for which initial reports have been made according to the
procedures described in this document. For these reportable events
follow-up and final reports will be submitted to the NCAs by the same
procedure, but all new reportable events shall be entered in Eudamed.
Whether retrospective uploading of previous event reports to Eudamed
will be possible is not clear at the time this guidance is issued.
4.2 Overview of formats to be used by sponsors when reporting to NCAs
Under directives legislation Until May 25th, 2021: Transition period
From May 26th, 2021 and until Eudamed is available When Eudamed is
available but not yet mandatory and until the timepoint when Eudamed
becomes mandatory
The tabular format from MEDDEV 2.7/3 Appendix I should be used The
Tabular format of this guidance (Appendix- Summary Reporting Form)
should be used.
Either the Tabular format of this guidance (Appendix- Summary Reporting
Form) or the Eudamed web form can be used. Note: Once the shift to
Eudamed reporting has been made for a specific clinical investigation,
Eudamed should continue to be used for reporting all new events and
updates to those events throughout the remainder of the clinical
investigation. From the timepoint when Eudamed is mandatory* *From the
date corresponding to six Web form via Eudamed shall be used for all new
events, and updates to those events. months after the date of
publication of the The Tabular format of this guidance (Appendix-
Summary Reporting Form) can be used only to transmit notice referred to
in Article 34(3) of the follow-up reports/final reports to the NCAs on
events which were initially reported in this format. MDR.
4.3 Collecting reports from investigators The format in which sponsors
wish to receive single event reports from investigators will be up to
the sponsor to design and they may be adapted to an individual clinical
investigation. When sponsors design such reporting forms, they should
consult this guidance document to ensure all relevant details are
captured in the reports from the investigator, so that the sponsors can
fulfil their reporting obligations.
5
Reportable events
For the purpose of this guidance and based on the definitions above, the
following events are considered reportable events in accordance with MDR
Art. 80(2): a) any serious adverse event that has a causal relationship
with the investigational device, the comparator or the investigation
procedure or where such causal relationship is reasonably possible; b)
any device deficiency that might have led to a serious adverse event if
appropriate action had not been taken, intervention had not occurred, or
circumstances had been less fortunate; c) any new findings in relation
to any event referred to in points a) and b). Serious adverse events
related to a CE marked device which is part of the investigation
procedure (for example a CE-marked implanting tool used in combination
with a non-CE marked investigational device) are reportable per MDR
Article 80(2) if there is a causal, (or reasonably possible)
relationship to the device, the comparator or the investigation
procedure. The reporting procedures described in this guide should then
be followed in addition to the normal vigilance reporting procedures for
CE marked devices.
Page 8 of 19
All causality assessments should be made using the guidance in section
9. Only causality level 1 (i.e. "not related") is excluded from
reporting. If either the sponsor or the investigator has assigned a
higher causality level than "not related", the event should be
reported. Type of Clinical Investigation

National legislation
No provisions in MDR. Safety reporting may be regulated in national
legislations in the country where the investigation is conducted.
5.1 Exceptions for PMCF investigations falling under MDR Article 74.1
Following Article 74.1 the SAE reporting for these PMCF clinical
investigations is governed by Articles 80(5) and 80(6). Thus the
provisions of vigilance laid down in Articles 87-90 and acts adopted
pursuant to Article 91 shall apply. However, the SAEs where a causal
relationship between the serious adverse event and the preceding
investigational procedure has been established shall follow the
reporting procedures of clinical investigations as outlined in Article
80. This means that: 

For the purpose of this guidance (safety reporting in clinical
investigations) reportable events in PMCF clinical investigations are
those serious adverse events where a causal relationship between the
serious adverse event and a preceding investigational procedure has been
established. The other relationship categories i.e. not related,
possible and probable do not need to be reported in the context of the
clinical investigation under Article 80. In the context of vigilance,
articles 87-90 need to be taken into account and this concerns the
Serious Incidents where a relationship between the incident and the
device or a procedure stated in the IFU is at least reasonably possible.
Also not related, possible and probable events need to be reported in
the context of vigilance (Art. 87-90).
It is thus possible that events occurring in such clinical
investigations need to be reported to both the competent authorities in
charge of SAE in clinical investigations AND to the competent
authorities in charge of vigilance, as outlined above, including a
relationship to a procedure stated in the IFU. Page 9 of 19
"Preceding investigational procedure" shall be understood as a procedure
which is imposed by the Clinical Investigation Plan and which has taken
place before (or coincided in time) with the serious adverse event. This
includes both the investigational device application procedure and any
additional burdensome or invasive procedure(s) which defines whether the
study is subject to notification requirements following MDR article
74(1).
5.2 Reportable events occurring in other Member States / Third Countries
5.2.1 Reportable events occurring in other MS The sponsor shall report
the reportable SAEs per clinical investigation (CI). If several CIs are
conducted with the same device, only those SAEs that happen in CIs that
have the same clinical investigation plan (CIP) code should be reported
for those CIs, and only to those MS where a CI with that specific CIP
code is being conducted. It is acknowledged that the same CI can be
conducted under different versions of the same clinical investigation
plan (same CIP code) in different Member States, e.g. with country
specific adaptations, and in those cases the SAE reporting can normally
be combined for all the versions of the CIP for the same clinical
investigation. 5.2.2 Reportable events occurring in Third Countries
Reportable events occurring in Third Countries4 in which a clinical
investigation is performed under the same clinical investigation plan (
s e e 5 . 2 . 1 Reportable events occurring in other MS for what is
meant with same CIP) have to be reported in accordance with this
guidance to the NCA(s) of the European countries in which the clinical
investigation is being conducted.  
The NCA shall start receiving the reportable events occurring in Third
Countries as soon as the clinical investigation is authorised to start
in that Member State. Events occurring in Third Countries after the
participating European sites have closed shall continue to be reported.
5.3 Transition period for reportable events in pre-market clinical
investigations initiated under directives legislation It is acknowledged
that the MDR implies changes to the reporting requirements compared to
the directives' requirements where all SAEs should be reported
regardless of relatedness. Under MDR sponsors are no longer obliged to
report SAEs that are "not related" to the clinical investigation
procedures or the investigational device. At the date of application for
MDR there will be ongoing events for clinical investigations initiated
under directives legislation. As from the 26th of May 2021 sponsors are
no longer expected to submit follow-up reports to NCAs for events that
have been deemed "not related" (see section 9 of this document for
guidance on causality assessment). For ongoing events that have a
causality assessment other than "not related" follow up reports will
still have to be provided. To facilitate the transition and give time
for sponsors to update Clinical Investigation Plans and study procedures
in clinical investigations a sponsor may continue to report all SAEs to
NCAs until Eudamed reporting is mandatory (see section 4.1 Transition to
reporting via Eudamed). This applies only to studies which have started
to be conducted5 in accordance with Article 10 of Directive 90/385/EEC
or Article 15 of Directive 93/42/EEC prior to 26 May 2021.
5.4 Transition for reportable events in PMCF clinical investigations
initiated under directives legislation In case of PMCF studies which
required SAE reporting according to the Pre-MDR national legislations,
MDR article 80 (5) and 80(6) shall apply from May 26th, 2021.
4
Countries other than Switzerland, Turkey and those belonging to the EEA.
For the purpose of safety reporting this is defined as "Authorised to
start in the individual Member State in line with applicable directives
legislation, regardless of whether any subjects have been recruited in
the Member State or not." 5
Page 10 of 19
6
Report by whom
Reportable events have to be reported by the sponsor of the clinical
investigation, which could be the manufacturer, the legal representative
or another person6 or entity,.
7
Report to whom
Reportable events must be reported at the same time to all NCAs where
the clinical investigation has commenced using the summary tabulation
featured in the Appendix. A list of clinical investigation contact
points within the NCAs is published at the Commission's homepage. For
the purpose of this guidance, an investigation is considered to have
commenced in an individual Member State: • •
For investigations under the directives: When the sponsor is authorized
to start the investigation in accordance with the notification
procedures in that Member State. For investigations started under the
MDR: When the sponsor is authorized to start the investigation in that
Member State in accordance with the provisions laid out in the MDR.
Member States may also require separate reporting to the Ethics
Committee(s).
8
Reporting timelines
8.1 Report by sponsor to NCAs. The sponsor must report to all NCAs where
the clinical investigation is authorised to start: •
For all reportable events as described in section 5 which indicate an
imminent risk of death, serious injury, or serious illness and that
requires prompt remedial action for other patients/subjects, users or
other persons or a new finding to it: Immediately, but not later than 2
calendar days after awareness by sponsor of a new reportable event or of
new information in relation with an already reported event. This
includes events that are of significant and unexpected nature such that
they become alarming as a potential public health hazard. It also
includes the possibility of multiple deaths occurring at short
intervals. These concerns may be identified by either the NCA or the
manufacturer.
•
Any other reportable events as described in section 5 or a new
finding/update to it: Immediately, but not later than 7 calendar days
following the date of awareness by the sponsor of the new reportable
event or of new information in relation with an already reported event.
In some cases, a different periodicity or different modalities may be
agreed between the participating NCAs and the sponsor according to the
investigation's design and to the pathology under clinical
investigation. This would allow implementation of adequate provision for
clinical investigations in which SAE frequency is expected to be high
due to the natural progression of the disease (e.g. palliative
oncology).

Contact person established by the sponsor in line with Article 62(2) if
accepted by Member State.
Page 11 of 19
8.2 Report by the investigator to the sponsor The sponsor shall
implement and maintain a system to ensure that the reporting of the
reportable events as defined under chapter 5 will be provided by the
investigator to the sponsor immediately, but not later than 3 calendar
days after investigation site study personnel's awareness of the event.
9
Causality assessment
The relationship between the use of the medical device7 (including the
medical - surgical procedure) and the occurrence of each adverse event
shall be assessed and categorized. During causality assessment activity,
clinical judgement shall be used and the relevant documents, such as the
Investigator's Brochure, the Clinical Investigation Plan or the Risk
Analysis Report shall be consulted, as all the foreseeable serious
adverse events and the potential risks are listed and assessed there8.
The presence of confounding factors, such as concomitant
medication/treatment, the natural history of the underlying disease,
other concurrent illness or risk factors shall also be considered. The
above considerations apply also to the serious adverse events occurring
in the comparison group. For the purpose of harmonizing reports, each
SAE will be classified according to four different levels of
causality: 1. 2. 3. 4.
Not related Possible Probable Causal relationship
The sponsor and the investigators will use the following definitions to
assess the relationship of the serious adverse event to the
investigational device, the comparator or the investigation
procedure. 1. Not related: Relationship to the device, comparator or
procedures can be excluded when: - the event has no temporal
relationship with the use of the investigational device, or the
procedures related to application of the investigational device; - the
serious adverse event does not follow a known response pattern to the
medical device (if the response pattern is previously known) and is
biologically implausible; - the discontinuation of medical device
application or the reduction of the level of activation/exposure - when
clinically feasible and reintroduction of its use (or increase of the
level of activation/exposure), do not impact on the serious adverse
event; - the event involves a body-site or an organ that cannot be
affected by the device or procedure; - the serious adverse event can be
attributed to another cause (e.g. an underlying or concurrent illness/
clinical condition, an effect of another device, drug, treatment or
other risk factors); - the event does not depend on a false result given
by the investigational device used for diagnosis9, when applicable; In
order to establish the non-relatedness, not all the criteria listed
above might be met at the same time, depending on the type of
device/procedures and the serious adverse event.
7
Intended as both investigational device and comparator. For a comparator
device, the Operator's Manual could be a relevant document. 9 If an
investigational device gives an incorrect diagnosis, the patient might,
for example, receive an unnecessary treatment and incur all the risks
that accompany that treatment, or might be incorrectly diagnosed with a
serious disease. In other cases, the patient might not receive an
effective treatment (thereby missing out on the benefits that treatment
would confer) or might not be diagnosed with the correct disease or
condition. 8
Page 12 of 19
2. Possible: The relationship with the use of the investigational device
or comparator, or the relationship with procedures, is weak but cannot
be ruled out completely. Alternative causes are also possible (e.g. an
underlying or concurrent illness/ clinical condition or/and an effect of
another device, drug or treatment). Cases where relatedness cannot be
assessed, or no information has been obtained should also be classified
as possible. 3. Probable: The relationship with the use of the
investigational device or comparator, or the relationship with
procedures, seems relevant and/or the event cannot be reasonably
explained by another cause. 4. Causal relationship: the serious adverse
event is associated with the investigational device, comparator or with
procedures beyond reasonable doubt when: - the event is a known side
effect of the product category the device belongs to or of similar
devices and procedures; -
the event has a temporal relationship with investigational device
use/application or procedures; the event involves a body-site or organ
that o the investigational device or procedures are applied to; o the
investigational device or procedures have an effect on;
-
the serious adverse event follows a known response pattern to the
medical device (if the response pattern is previously known); the
discontinuation of medical device application (or reduction of the level
of activation/exposure) and reintroduction of its use (or increase of
the level of activation/exposure), impact on the serious adverse event
(when clinically feasible); other possible causes (e.g. an underlying or
concurrent illness/ clinical condition or/and an effect of another
device, drug or treatment) have been adequately ruled out; harm to the
subject is due to error in use;
- the event depends on a false result given by the investigational
device used for diagnosis10, when applicable; In order to establish the
relatedness, not all the criteria listed above might be met at the same
time, depending on the type of device/procedures and the serious adverse
event. The sponsor and the investigators will distinguish between the
serious adverse events related to the investigational device and those
related to the procedures (any procedure specific to the clinical
investigation). An adverse event can be related both to procedures and
the investigational device. Complications caused by concomitant
treatments not imposed by the clinical investigation plan are considered
not related. Similarly, several routine diagnostic or patient management
procedures are applied to patients regardless of the clinical
investigation plan. If routine procedures are not imposed by the
clinical investigation plan, complications caused by them are also
considered not related. The relationship between a serious adverse event
and the procedure or the device, needs to be assessed separately. This
does however not mean that they are mutually exclusive, a serious
adverse event can be related to both the procedure and the device, or it
can be related only to the procedure or only to the device. When it is
unclear whether an event is related to the device or to the procedure,
the investigator should: • set the Relationship to device to possible
(or higher) AND • set the Relationship to procedure to possible (or
higher)
10
If an investigational device gives an incorrect diagnosis, the patient
might, for example, receive an unnecessary treatment and incur all the
risks that accompany that treatment, or might be incorrectly diagnosed
with a serious disease. In other cases, the patient might not receive an
effective treatment (thereby missing out on the benefits that treatment
would confer), or might not be diagnosed with the correct disease or
condition.
Page 13 of 19
Since it is the healthcare provider who performs the procedures and
manages/handles the medical device(s), the causality assessment of this
healthcare provider should prevail. In some particular cases the event
may not be adequately assessed because information is insufficient or
contradictory and/or the data cannot be verified or supplemented. The
sponsor and the Investigators will make the maximum effort to define and
categorize the event and avoid these situations. Where an investigator
assessment is not available and/or the sponsor remains uncertain about
classifying the serious adverse event, the sponsor should not exclude
the relatedness; the event should be classified as "possible" and the
reporting not be delayed. Particular attention shall be given to the
causality evaluation of unanticipated serious adverse events. The
occurrence of unanticipated events related could suggest that the
clinical investigation places subjects at increased risk of harm than
was to be expected beforehand.
10 Reporting form The reporting form template for the summary SAE
tabulation is given in the Appendix of this document. The reporting form
is study specific and covers only a given clinical investigation,
defined by a distinct clinical investigation plan. English is the
recommended language for the reporting form. The report form can be
modified in any applicable software (not only Microsoft Excel) but the
file needs to be compatible with Microsoft Excel when sent to the
participating NCAs. The template form contains inserted filters and
functionality to facilitate use of preferred terminology in the
reporting. These are important for the analysis and should be
maintained. Sponsors who generate the excel report file by automated
processes may implement other technical features in their systems for
excel file generation to ensure the preferred terms listed in metadata
are used. The table gives a cumulative overview of the reportable events
per clinical investigation and will be updated and transmitted to
participating NCAs each time a new reportable event or a new finding to
an already reported event is to be reported. More detailed information
has to be provided on request of an NCA, if so requested by using the
individual study specific reporting form (see further section 4.3
Collecting reports from investigators).
10.1 Completion guidelines: Form header 10.1.1 EUDAMED/CIV-ID The
union-wide Single Identification Number mentioned in MDR Article 70(1)
will not be possible to generate until Eudamed for MDR is fully
functional. For the transition period, clinical investigations will get
tracking numbers (CIV-ID) upon registration in the Eudamed2 database
which is performed by the NCA upon receipt of an application. This CIV
ID is provided to the sponsor during the NCA's handling of the initial
application for the clinical investigation and should be entered on the
safety reporting form. The CIV ID should already be available for a
clinical investigation started under the directives' legislation, where
it should be indicated on the MEDDEV 2.7/3 reporting form etc. Sponsors
who are not aware of the CIV ID of their clinical investigations are
invited to contact the concerned NCA to get this information. 10.1.2
Title of Clinical Investigation The identifying title of the Clinical
Investigation. The title indicated here should be consistent with other
title entries (such as in clinical investigation application form,

respective columns. 10.2.21 Unanticipated SADE Choose option Yes or No
An Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device Effect12 is an effect which by
its nature, incidence, severity or outcome has not been identified in
the current risk assessment. Procedures associated with the use of a
device should be addressed in the risk assessment, which makes it
possible to determine whether the procedure related SAEs are
Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device Effect or not. SAEs related to
procedures imposed by the clinical investigation plan but not with the
use of the device should not be considered Serious Adverse Device
Effects. 10.2.22 Investigation arm Choose one option from the following
list:    
Test group Comparison group Blinded Not applicable
Note: For some study designs it might be more relevant to add name of
device; i.e. in a clinical investigation with several test groups it
might be useful to differentiate which investigational device that the
subject has been exposed to. 10.2.23 Event status Choose one option from
the following list (do not add other options):    
Resolved Resolved with Sequelae Ongoing Death
10.2.24 Date of event resolution Add date in format DD/MM/YYYY. If event

1. Scope and purpose of this document This document, which primarily
targets medical software manufacturers, defines the criteria for the
qualification of software falling within the scope of the new medical
devices regulations1 and provides guidance on the application of
classification criteria for software under Regulation (EU) 2017/745 --
MDR and Regulation (EU) 2017/746 -- IVDR.2 The guidance also provides
information related to placing on the market. The classification
criteria (classification rules) are set out in Annex VIII of the Medical
Devices Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (MDR) and Annex VIII of the In vitro
Diagnostic Medical Devices Regulation (EU) 2017/746 (IVDR). The criteria
specified in this document shall also apply to applications (commonly
referred to as apps), may they be operating on a mobile phone, in the
cloud or on other platforms.
2. Definitions and abbreviations Intended purpose: According to
Regulation (EU) 2017/745 -- MDR, "Intended purpose" means the use for
which a device is intended according to the data supplied by the
manufacturer on the label, in the instructions for use or in promotional
or sales materials or statements and as specified by the manufacturer in
the clinical evaluation;3 According to Regulation (EU) 2017/746 -- IVDR,
"Intended purpose" means the use for which a device is intended
according to the data supplied by the manufacturer on the label, in the
instructions for use or in promotional or sales materials or statements
or as specified by the manufacturer in the performance evaluation;4
Accessory: According to Regulation (EU) 2017/745 -- MDR, "Accessory for
a medical device" means an article which, whilst not being itself a
medical device, is intended by its manufacturer to be used together with
one or several particular medical device(s) to specifically enable the
medical device(s) to be used in accordance with its/their intended
purpose(s) or to specifically and directly assist the medical
functionality of the medical device(s) in terms of its/their intended
purpose(s);5 According to Regulation (EU) 2017/746 -- IVDR, "Accessory
for an in vitro diagnostic medical device" means an article which,
whilst not being itself an in vitro diagnostic medical device, is
intended by its manufacturer to be used together with one or several
particular in vitro diagnostic medical device(s) to specifically enable
the in vitro diagnostic medical device(s) to be used in accordance with
its/their intended purpose(s) or to specifically and directly assist the
medical functionality of the in vitro diagnostic medical device(s) in
terms of its/their intended purpose(s);6 Note: Software accessory may be
driving or influencing the use of a medical device. Note: Manufacturers
must describe in the technical documentation accessories of a medical
device or an in vitro diagnostic medical device which are intended to be
used in combination with it; and in case
1
The use of "The Medical Devices Regulations" from here on out refers to
both Regulation (EU) 2017/745 -- MDR and Regulation (EU) 2017/746 --
IVDR. 2 It shall be noted that the term "standalone software" which was
used in the text of the medical device directives, is no longer used in
the context of the Medical Device Regulation. The rationale of the
change is that software should be qualified and classified depending on
its intended purpose uniquely, regardless of its location. 3 Article

mental impairments; - concerning the predisposition to a medical
condition or a disease; - to determine the safety and compatibility with
potential recipients; - to predict treatment response or reactions; - to
define or monitoring therapeutic measures. Specimen receptacles shall
also be deemed to be in vitro diagnostic medical devices;14
Software: For the purpose of this guidance, "software" is defined as a
set of instructions that processes input data and creates output data.
Input data: Any data provided to software in order to obtain output data
after computation of this data can be considered as input data. Input
data examples (non-exhaustive): - Data given through the use of a human
data-input device such as a keyboard, mouse, stylus, or touch screen; -
Data given through speech recognition; - Digital document: formatted for
general purpose such as Word file or pdf file or jpeg image, formatted
for medical purpose such as DICOM file or ECG records or Electronic
Health Record, unformatted document. Note that digital documents have to
be differentiated from software able to read such documents; - Data
received from/transmitted by devices.
Output data: Any data produced by a software can be considered as an
output data. Output data examples (nonexhaustive): - Screen display data
(such as layout with number, characters, picture, graphics, etc.); -
Print data (such as layout with number, characters, picture, graphics,
etc.); - Audio data; - Digital document (formatted for a general purpose
such as Word file or pdf file or jpeg image, or formatted for medical
purpose such as DICOM file or ECG records or Electronic Health Record,
unformatted document). - Haptic buzzing as an alternative to audio sound
Software driving or influencing the use of a device Software which is
intended to drive or influence the use of a (hardware) medical device
and does not have or perform a medical purpose on its own, nor does it
create information on its own for one or more of the medical purposes
described in the definition of a medical device or an in vitro
diagnostic medical device. This software can, but is not limited to: (a)
operate, modify the state of, or control the device either through an
interface (e.g., software, hardware) or via the operator of this device
(b) or supply output related to the (hardware) functioning of that
device Note: Software driving or influencing the use of a (hardware)
medical device may be qualified as an accessory for a (hardware) medical
device. 14

Medical Device Software (MDSW) Medical device software is software that
is intended to be used, alone or in combination, for a purpose as
specified in the definition of a "medical device" in the medical devices
regulation15 or in vitro diagnostic medical devices regulation.16
3. Qualification 3.1.
Introduction to qualification criteria
The purpose of this section is to clarify what software is in itself
subject to the medical devices regulations. Software must have a medical
purpose on its own to be qualified as a medical device software (MDSW).
It should be noted that the intended purpose as described by the
manufacturer of the software is relevant for the qualification and
classification of any device. In order to be qualified as medical device
software, the product must first fulfil the definition of software
according to this guidance and the definition of a medical device
according to Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) 2017/745 -- MDR. To be
qualified as an in vitro diagnostic medical device software, the product
must additionally fulfil the definition of an in vitro diagnostic
medical device according to Article 2(2) of Regulation (EU) 2017/746 --
IVDR. Where a given product does not fall under the definition of a
medical device, or is excluded by the scope of the Medical Devices
Regulations, other Community and/or national legislation may be
applicable. Software that does not meet the definition of a medical
device or an in vitro diagnostic medical device (i.e. software that is
not MDSW) but is intended by the manufacturer to be an accessory for a
medical device, or an in vitro diagnostic medical device, falls
respectively under the scope of the Regulation (EU) 2017/745 -- MDR or
Regulation (EU) 2017/746 -- IVDR. Software can directly control a
(hardware) medical device (e.g. radiotherapy treatment software), can
provide immediate decision-triggering information (e.g. blood glucose
meter software), or can provide support for healthcare professionals
(e.g. ECG interpretation software). It is important to clarify that not
all software used within healthcare is qualified as a medical device.
For example, "Simple search", which refers to the retrieval of records
by matching record metadata against record search criteria or to the
retrieval of information does not qualify as medical device software
(e.g. library functions). However, software which is intended to
process, analyse, create or modify medical information may be qualified
as a medical device software if the creation or modification of that
information is governed by a medical intended purpose. For example, the
software which alters the representation of data for a medical purpose
would qualify as a medical device software. (e.g. "searching image for
findings that support a clinical hypothesis as to the diagnosis or
evolution of therapy" or "software which locally amplifies the contrast
of the finding on an image display so that it serves as a decision
support or suggests an action to be taken by the user"). However,
altering the representation of data for embellishment/cosmetic or
compatibility purposes does not readily qualify the software as medical
device software. Software intended for non-medical purposes (excluding
MDR Annex XVI devices), such as invoicing or staff planning, does not
qualify as a medical device software. These software do not fall under
the Medical Devices Regulations.

A task such as e-mailing, web or voice messaging, data parsing, word
processing, and back-up is by itself not considered as having a medical
purpose. Additionally, software may run on different operating systems
or in virtual environments. These operating systems or virtual
environments do not impact the qualification criteria. It must be
highlighted that the risk of harm to patients, users of the software, or
any other person, related to the use of the software within healthcare,
including a possible malfunction is not a criterion on whether the
software qualifies as a medical device.
3.2.
Medical Device Software (MDSW)
Medical device software is software that is intended to be used, alone
or in combination, for a purpose as specified in the definition of a
"medical device" in the MDR or IVDR, regardless of whether the software
is independent or driving or influencing the use of a device. Note 1:
MDSW may be independent, by having its own intended medical purpose and
thus meeting the definition of a medical device or in vitro diagnostic
medical device on its own (i.e. alone) MDSW that uses maternal
parameters such as age, concentration of serum markers and information
obtained through foetal ultrasound examination for evaluating the risk
of trisomy 21. MDSW that receives measurements from transrectal
ultrasound findings, age, and in vitro diagnostic instruments and
calculates a patient's risk of developing prostate cancer. Mass
Spectrometry MDSW intended to analyse LC-MS/MS data to be used for
microorganism identification and detection of antibiotic resistance.
MDSW smartwatch app, which is intended to send alarm notifications to
the user and/or health practitioner when it recognises irregular
heartbeats for the purpose of detecting cardiac arrhythmia. Note 2: If
the software drives or influences a (hardware) medical device and also
has a medical purpose, then it is qualified as a MDSW Melanoma image
analysis software intended to drive a near-infrared laser light scanner.
MDSW intended to measure and transmit blood glucose levels, calculate
insulin dose required and drive the insulin pump to administer the
calculated dosage (closed loop insulin delivery system). Note 3:
Software may be qualified as MDSW regardless of its location (e.g.
operating in the cloud, on a computer, on a mobile phone, or as an
additional functionality on a hardware medical device). MDSW that is
intended to operate a point of care test from a remote location. Note 4:
MDSW may be intended to be used by healthcare professionals or
laypersons (e.g. patients or other users).17, 18 MDSW that provides
insulin dose recommendations to a patient regardless of the method of
delivery of the prescribed dose, whether via an insulin pump, insulin
pen or insulin syringe.
17 Where MDSW is intended to be used by a lay person, the manufacturer
shall apply safety and performance requirements outlined in MDR Annex I.
22 and 23.4 (w); or IVDR Annex I. 9.4 and 20.4.2. 18 MDSW which can be
considered as an IVD for self-testing shall be considered as a device
intended to be used by laypersons.

Manufacturers must ensure that all regulatory requirements for placing
on the market and conformity assessment have been fulfilled. As set out
in Article 7 of MDR and IVDR, this also entails that any claims,
relating to the intended medical purpose of their MDSW are supported by
clinical evidence. If this is not the case, the software would not meet
the requirements of the regulations and therefore may not be CE marked
as a medical device, nor present said claims.
3.3.
'Software driving or influencing the use of a medical device'
Is software intended to drive or influence the use of a (hardware)
medical device and does not have or perform a medical purpose on its
own, nor does it create information on its own for one or more of the
medical purposes described in the definition of a medical device or an
in vitro diagnostic medical device. This software can, but is not
limited to: a) operate, modify the state of, or control the device
either through an interface (e.g., software, hardware) or via the
operator of this device b) or supply output related to the (hardware)
functioning of that device Note: Software that is driving or influencing
the use of a medical device is covered by the medical devices
regulations either as a part/component of a device or as an accessory
for a medical device. (refer to Figure 2, box 2). Software that is
intended to be used to operate a clinical chemistry analyser. Software
with built-in electronic controls for IVD quality control procedures.
These quality control procedures are intended to provide users with
assurance that the device is performing within specifications.
Decision steps for qualification of software as MDSW (Figure 1) Decision
step 1: if the product is software according to Section 2 (Definitions
and Abbreviations) of this guidance, then it may be a medical device
software, proceed to decision step 2; if the product is not software
according to the definition of this guidance, then it is not covered by
this guidance but may still be covered by the Medical Devices
Regulations. Decision step 2: if the product is an MDR Annex XVI device,
or is an accessory for a medical device19, or is software driving or
influencing the use of a medical device, then it must be considered as
part of that device in its regulatory process or independently if it is
an accessory. If it is not, proceed to decision step 3. Decision step 3:
if the software does perform an action on data, or performs an action
beyond storage, archival, communication20, simple search, lossless
compression (i.e. using a compression procedure that allows the exact
reconstruction of the original data) then it may be a medical device
software (Refer to section 3.1 for more guidance on these software
functions) proceed to step 4. Decision step 4: is the action for the
benefit of individual patients? Examples of software which are not
considered as being for the benefit of individual patients are those
which are intended only to aggregate population data, provide generic
diagnostic or treatment pathways (not directed to individual patients),
scientific literature, medical atlases, models and templates as well as
software intended only for epidemiological studies or registers.
Decision step 5: Is the software medical device software (MDSW)
according to the definition of this guidance?

Qualification criteria of MDSW as an in vitro diagnostic medical device
Medical Device Software (MDSW) fulfilling the definition of an in vitro
diagnostic medical device falls under the in vitro diagnostic medical
devices Regulation (EU) 2017/746. Provided that MDSW is intended
specifically by its manufacturer to be used together with an in vitro
diagnostic medical device to enable it to be used in accordance with its
intended purpose, this MDSW falls under the scope of the in vitro
diagnostic medical devices regulation and shall be treated as an In
Vitro Diagnostic MDSW (IVD MDSW) in its own right. In cases when
software is driving or influencing the use of a (hardware) device, the
software should be considered as falling under the respective regulation
of the driven or influenced (hardware) device. Software that analyses
and interprets the optical density delivered by an ELISA reader, line or
spot pattern of a blot. Such software takes raw data outputs and use
clinical algorithms for diagnostic and/or prognostic purposes, in which
case it qualifies as IVD MDSW.
Decision steps for qualification of MDSW as either a medical device or
an in vitro diagnostic medical device (Figure 2) Decision Step 1: Does
the Medical Device Software (MDSW) provide information within the scope
of the in vitro diagnostic medical device definition? MDSW which
provides information according to Regulation (EU) 2017/746 -- IVDR
Article 2(2) (a) to (f) should qualify as In Vitro Diagnostic Medical
Device Software (IVD MDSW) (a) concerning a physiological or
pathological process or state (by investigation of this process or
state); or (b) concerning congenital physical or mental impairments (c)
concerning the predisposition to a medical condition or a disease; (d)
to determine the safety and compatibility with potential recipients; (e)
to predict treatment response or reactions; (f) to define or monitoring
therapeutic measures. A MDSW which falls under the definition set out in
EU Article 2 (1) of Regulation (EU) 2017/745 -- MDR should qualify as
Medical Device Software (MD MDSW). In specific, the following
considerations should apply on the provision of information by software
on: (g) diagnosis, prevention, monitoring, prediction, prognosis,
treatment or alleviation of disease (h) diagnosis, monitoring,
treatment, alleviation of, or compensation for, an injury or disability,
(i) investigation, replacement or modification of the anatomy or of a
physiological or pathological process or state, (j) control or support
of conception; (k) products specifically intended for the cleaning,
disinfection or sterilization of devices as referred to in Article 1(4)
and Annex XVI products. Decision Step 2: Does the MDSW create
information based on data obtained by in vitro diagnostic medical
devices only? If the information provided is based on data obtained
solely from in vitro diagnostic medical devices, then the software is an
in vitro diagnostic medical device and is therefore an IVD MDSW. If the
data analysed is obtained from a combination of both in vitro diagnostic
medical devices and medical devices, proceed to step 3.
Page 10 of 28
Decision Step 3: Is the intended purpose substantially driven by data
sources coming from in vitro diagnostic medical devices? If yes, then
the applicable legislation is Regulation (EU) 2017/746. If the intended
purpose is substantially driven by data sources coming from medical
devices, then the applicable legislation is Regulation (EU) 2017/745. In
the condition where the intended purpose of the MDSW output data fulfils
both the medical device and in vitro diagnostic medical device
definitions set out in the MDR and IVDR (refer to Decision Step 2), a
weighting of the data sources based on the significance of the
information21 in relation to fulfilling the intended purpose should be
conducted to aid the manufacturer in determining which regulation to
apply. Annex II of this guidance offers some prescriptive examples of
how such a weighting may be performed.
21 A qualitative approach is intended to drive the weighting of data.
The weighing aims to assess the contribution of each data towards
achieving the result.

4. Classification of MDSW per MDR 2017/745 4.1.
Implementing Rules
All implementing rules in Annex VIII of Regulation (EU) 2017/745 shall
be considered. Special considerations on Implementing Rule 3.3 and 3.5:
The first sentence of implementing rule 3.3 of Annex VIII clarifies the
regime applicable to software driving or influencing the use of a
device: 'Software, which drives or influences the use of a device, shall
fall within the same class as the device' The second sentence of
implementing rule 3.3 of Annex VIII clarifies that the regime applicable
to Independent MDSW: 'If software is independent of any other device, it
shall be classified in its own right' This rule should also be
considered at least as an orientation for finding the correct (minimum)
classification of software which is placed on the market in combination
with a (hardware) medical device. Therefore, Medical Device Software
that both achieves its own intended purpose and also drives or
influences the use of a (hardware) device for a medical purpose is
classified on its own, based on the intended purpose achieved. In such a
case, however, the risk class shall not be lower than the risk class of
the hardware medical device. Implementing rule 3.5 of Annex VIII is
relevant for all devices and states that 'If several rules, or if,
within the same rule, several sub-rules, apply to the same device based
on the device's intended purpose, the strictest rule and sub-rule
resulting in higher classification will apply' Melanoma image analysis
software intended to be used with a near-infrared laser light scanner,
which is considered class IIa per Rule 10. The software "drives or
influences the use of" the nearinfrared laser light scanner as it is
intended to take control of the scanner by letting it execute
proprietary multi-exposure programs for the detection of melanoma. As
such, implementing rule 3.3 applies. However, Rule 11 would also apply
based on the intended medical purpose of the software e.g. cancer
diagnosis. The MDSW would be classified as class III based on Rule 11
(see section Classification Rules) and per implementing rule 3.5 of
Annex VIII.
4.2.
Classification Rules
Rules 9, 10 and 12 mainly categorise the risks related to the exchange
of energy/substances between the body and diagnostic or therapeutic
active devices, taking into account the different healthcare situations
(condition of patients). MDSW, in the majority of cases, does not
(directly) relate to such risks. It relates to the consequences of
indirect harm from failure to provide correct information. Therefore, in
line with Recital 5 of the Medical Device Regulation and international
guidance from the IMDRF (International Medical Device Regulators
Forum)22, Rule 11 was introduced into the MDR and is intended to address
the risks related to the information provided by an active device, such
as MDSW. Rule 11, in particular, describes and categorises the
significance of the information provided by the active device to the
healthcare decision (patient management) in combination with the
healthcare situation (patient condition). As software is defined as an
active device, for the classification of active (hardware) devices,
which also includes MDSW providing information for patient management,
Rules 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15 and
22
IMDRF is a voluntary group of medical device regulators from around the
world who have come together to build on the strong foundational work of
the Global Harmonization Task Force on Medical Devices (GHTF) and aims
to accelerate international medical device regulatory harmonization and
convergence.
Page 12 of 28
22 of Annex VIII MDR 2017/745 should be considered. In line with
implementation rule 3.5, the strictest rule or sub-rule should hence
apply. MDSW should be classified in the same way, regardless of the
software's location or the type of interconnection between the software
and a (hardware) device.
4.2.1.
Rule 11 -- Software for decisions with diagnosis or therapeutic purposes
or software intended to monitor physiological processes
Rule 11 states: Software intended to provide information which is used
to take decisions with diagnosis or therapeutic purposes is classified
as class IIa, except if such decisions have an impact that may cause:
death or an irreversible deterioration of a person's state of health,
in which case it is in class III; or a serious deterioration of a
person's state of health or a surgical intervention, in which case it
is classified as class IIb. Software intended to monitor physiological
processes is classified as class IIa, except if it is intended for
monitoring of vital physiological parameters, where the nature of
variations of those parameters is such that it could result in immediate
danger to the patient, in which case it is classified as class IIb. All
other software is classified as class I. The text of Rule 11 can be
divided into what are essentially three sub-rules that are applied
depending on the intended use/purpose of the MDSW: 11a: (3 first
paragraphs of Rule 11) intended to provide information which is used to
take decisions with diagnostic or therapeutic purposes; 11b: (Paragraph
4 of Rule 11) intended to monitor physiological processes or parameters;
11c: (Paragraph 5 of Rule 11) all other uses. Sub-rule 11a): The wording
"intended to provide information which is used to take decisions with
diagnosis or therapeutic purposes" describes, in very general terms, the
"mode of action" which is characteristic of all MDSW. Therefore, this
sub-rule is generally applicable to all MDSW (excluding those MDSW that
have no medical purpose). Sub-rule 11a), states that MDSW (which is
intended to provide information which is used to take decisions with
diagnosis or therapeutic purposes) is classified as class IIa. There are
two exceptions from sub-rule 11a) that are mainly intended to apply a
risk classification based on the significance of the provided
information and the potential impact of an (incorrect) decision made
using information from the MDSW.23 Accordingly, MDSW that is intended to
provide information which is used to take decisions with diagnosis and
therapeutic purposes, is at a higher risk class where such decisions, if
based on incorrect information from the MDSW, are reasonably likely to
have an impact that may cause: i. ii.
death or an irreversible deterioration of a person's state of health,
in which case it is in class III; serious deterioration of a person's
state of health or surgical intervention, in which case it is classified
as class IIb.
23
Compare IMDRF/SaMD WG/N12FINAL:2014 which states that there are two
major factors that provide adequate description of the intended use of
software: A. - Significance of the information provided by the software
to the healthcare decision and B. - State of the healthcare situation or
patient condition.
Page 13 of 28
The MDR contains several references to "serious deterioration of a
person's state of health" and "surgical intervention", notably in the
vigilance or clinical investigation context. Further horizontal guidance
could be provided in the future and will be available at:
https://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/medical-devices/new-regulations/guidance_en
Rule 11 was also introduced to mirror the regulatory guidance developed
at international level and notably in the context of the International
Medical Device Regulators Forum (IMDRF). The IMDRF framework for risk
categorisation of software as a medical device (SaMD) ("IMDRF Risk
Framework") categorises the risk of software based on the combination of
the significance of the information provided by the software to the
healthcare decision and the healthcare situation or patient condition.
IMDRF also developed a table for assisting operators in identifying the
appropriate risk category for their own product. Such a table could
provide operators placing MDSW on the EU market with some useful
indications on the risk class applicable to their products as a result
of the application of Rule 11 of the MDR. For this purpose, a table is
provided in Annex III to this document which lists the IMDRF risk
categories and the possible corresponding MDR risk classes according to
Rule 11 of the MDR. It must be noted that this table does not take into
account MDSW which is Class I. Sub-rule 11b): MDSW that is intended to
monitor physiological processes will, under most circumstances, provide
"information which is used to take decisions with diagnosis or
therapeutic purposes and hence fall under sub-rule 11a. Sub-rule 11b)
should therefore be considered as a specific rule for MDSW intended only
for monitoring purposes. Sub-rule 11b) was introduced to ensure that
MDSW which has the same intended purpose as (hardware) devices which
would fall under rule 10, third indent, are in the same risk class.
However, this sub rule applies to MDSW intended to be used for
monitoring any/all physiological processes and not just vital
physiological processes (equivalent to rule 10, third indent). Vital
physiological processes and parameters include, for example,
respiration, heart rate, cerebral functions, blood gases, blood pressure
and body temperature. Sub-rule 11c): Sub-rule 11c) implies that all
other MDSW is classified as class I.
4.2.2.
Rule 12 -- Active devices intended to administer and/or remove
substances
As software devices cannot physically administer and/or remove
substances, please refer to the implementation rule 3.3 of Annex VIII
for MDSW covered by this rule.
4.2.3.
Rule 13 -- All other active devices
Taking into consideration all implementing and classification rules
applicable to active devices, if no other rule applies, all other active
devices are class I. 24
4.2.4.
Rule 15 - Devices used for contraception
Rule 15 applies to devices used for contraception or prevention of the
transmission of sexually transmitted diseases. Software used for
contraception will be classified as class IIb.
24 Specific implementation or classification rules for active Annex XVI
devices (which might also include software) are expected to be provided
together with the relevant Common Specifications for those devices.
Page 14 of 28
4.2.5.
Rule 22 -- Closed loop systems
Active therapeutic devices with an integrated or incorporated diagnostic
function which significantly determines the patient management by the
device, such as closed loop systems or automated external
defibrillators, are classified as class III. See also implementing rule
3.3 for MDSW covered by this rule. Further horizontal Guidance on the
application of MD classification and implementing rules can be found at
https://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/medical-devices/new-regulations/guidance_en.
This is expected to provide useful orientation in relation to the
application of non-software specific classification rules.
5. Classification and implementing rules per IVDR 2017/746 5.1.
Implementing Rules:
All implementing rules in Annex VIII of Regulation (EU) 2017/746 shall
be considered. Special considerations on Implementing Rule 1.4 and 1.9:
Implementing rule 1.4 is only applicable for software which drives or
influences the use of an in vitro diagnostic medical device. This rule
should also be considered at least as an orientation for finding the
right (minimum) classification of software which is placed on the market
in combination with a (hardware) medical device. According to the second
sentence of implementing rule 1.4, if the software is independent of any
other device, it shall be classified in its own right. Examples for
applying this implementing rule under the in vitro diagnostic medical
devices regulation: • Software that is exclusively intended to drive or
influence the use of an instrument intended by the manufacturer
specifically to be used for in vitro diagnostic procedures is classified
in the same class as the instrument. • A software that is intended to
operate (driving) a C-reactive protein (CRP) measuring analyser from a
remote location is classified in the same class as the analyser i.e. if
the analyser is a classified as class A then the software operating the
analyser falls into Class A. •
MDSW that integrates genotype of multiple genes to predict risk a
disease or medical condition developing or recurring; this is an
independent IVD MDSW and is classified on its own.
Implementing rule 1.9 states that if several classification rules apply
to the same device based on the devices' intended purpose, the rule
resulting in higher classification will apply. To classify In Vitro
Diagnostic Medical Device Software (IVD MDSW) which is independent of
any other device, see the MDCG Guidance on Classification of IVDs when
available at
https://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/medical-devices/new-regulations/guidance_en.
5.2.
Classification Rules:
In determining the proper classification of MDSW under the IVDR, the
manufacturer shall consider all classification and implementing rules of
Annex VIII of the IVD Regulation (EU) 2017/746. As spelled out by
Implementing Rule 1.1 of Annex VIII of Regulation (EU) 2017/746, the
application of the classification rules shall be governed by the
intended purpose of the MDSW.
Page 15 of 28
Guidance on the application of the IVD classification and implementing
rules can be found at
https://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/medical-devices/new-regulations/guidance_en25
Examples for the classification of MDSW under the IVDR: • Software
intended to be installed on a fully automated enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analyser, and intended to determine the
Human HbA1c concentration in serum from the results obtained with a
Human HbA1c ELISA, intended to screen for and diagnose diabetes and
monitor diabetic patients, should be in class C per Rule 3(k). •
Software within a PAP stain automated cervical cytology screening
system, intended to classify the PAP cervical smear as either normal or
suspicious, should be in class C per Rule 3(h). • Software for the
interpretation of automated readings of line immunoassay for the
confirmation and determination of antibodies to HIV-1, HIV-1 group O and
HIV-2 in human serum and plasma, should be in class D per Rule 1. •
Software that uses maternal parameters such as age, concentration of
serum markers and information obtained through foetal ultrasound
examination for evaluating the risk of trisomy 21, should be in class C
per Rule 3(l). Classification examples in Annex IV are provided for
guidance purposes and aim to illustrate how a particular rule may be
applied to a device. The indicated classification in the example is not
a confirmation of the final classification of the device, as other rules
must also be considered.
6. Considerations on placing on the market and conformity assessment of
MDSW The type of interconnection between the MDSW and the device (e.g.
embedded systems, wires, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth) does not affect the
qualification of the software as a device under the MDR and IVDR (e.g.
whether the software is incorporated in a device or is at a different
location). However, MDSW can be placed on the market in two different
ways: as a medical device or in-vitro diagnostic medical device in its
own right or as an integral component or part of a hardware device.
6.1.
Option 1: as a medical device in its own right
MDSW may be placed on the market or put into service in its own right. •
MDSW intended to be installed on a fully automated enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analyser, and intended to determine the
Human HbA1c concentration in serum from the results obtained with a
Human HbA1c ELISA. • MDSW app that provides a 10-year risk of
cardiovascular disease from data input by a lay user. • MDSW app that
calculates anticoagulant dosage for patients in oral anticoagulant
therapy, from INR test results input by IVD instruments and other
manually entered patient data. • MDSW app that analyses digital images
of stained HEp-2 cell substrates from a microscope, for detecting
antinuclear antibody (ANA) patterns to guide confirmatory testing useful
in elucidating a specific clinical diagnosis or prognosis. Conformity
assessment: 25 Please note that at the time of the adoption of this
document, the referenced Guidance on the application of IVDR
classification and implementing rules was under finalisation.
Page 16 of 28
MDSW placed on the market as a device or put into service in its own
right shall undergo an appropriate regulatory process that shall take
into consideration the qualification, classification and intended
purpose of the MDSW.
6.2.
Option 2: as an integral component/part of a device
MDSW may be placed on the market or put into service as an integral
component/part of a device. • MDSW contained within a blood gas analyser
that enables a user to run tests on the instrument. • MDSW that is part
of a handheld hardware device intended for near-patient testing (POCT:
point of care testing) for the determination of the blood glucose
concentration. • A fully automated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) analyser, composed of hardware and MDSW, intended to determine
the Human HbA1c concentration in serum from the results obtained with a
Human HbA1c ELISA. • MDSW that is part of a pulse oximeter intended to
digitally filter the noise from low perfusion performance and motion
artefacts, to calculate the ratio of red light/infrared light and to use
a lookup table based on Beer-Lambert law to convert the ratio into the
oxygen saturation in a person's blood (SpO2). Conformity assessment:
MDSW that is placed on the market or put into service solely as an
integral component/part of a (hardware) device may not have to undergo
its own regulatory process.26 In this case, the MDSW shall be assessed
through the regulatory process applied to the device as a whole, as it
is placed on the market. Applying the classification rules to these
hardware devices, which is de-facto a combination of the hardware device
and the MDSW, requires careful consideration of the intended purpose of
the MDSW. This must also be analysed when later changes to the MDSW are
done. Note: MDSW could be independent under both scenarios described in
6.1 and 6.2, despite the presentation in which it is placed on the
market.
7. Modules Some medical device software may be segregated into a number
of applications where each of these applications is correlated with a
module. Some of these modules have a medical purpose, some not. Such
modules may be intended to cover many needs, e.g.: • • • • • •
Collect and maintain administrative patient data; Keep on file the
medical history of the patient; Invoicing and other accounting
functions; Provide a link to the social security system for
reimbursement; Provide a link to drug prescription systems (with
possible link to drug dispensing outlets); Provide expert system
assistance for medical decision making (e.g. radiotherapy dose planner).
26
Note: MDSW that is intended specifically to replace a part or component
of a device and that significantly changes the performance or safety
characteristics or the intended purpose of the device shall be
considered to be a device and shall meet the requirements laid down in
this Regulation (see Article 23.2 (2)).
Page 17 of 28
This raises the issue as to whether the whole product can be CE marked
when not all applications have a medical purpose. Computer programmes
used in healthcare can have applications which consist of both medical
device and non-medical device modules. The modules which are subject to
the Medical Devices Regulations (figure 1 and 2) must comply with the
requirements of the medical device regulations and must carry the CE
marking. The non-medical device modules are not subject to the
requirements for medical devices. It is the obligation of the
manufacturer to identify the boundaries and the interfaces of the
different modules. The boundaries of the modules which are subject to
the medical device regulations should be clearly identified by the
manufacturer based on the intended use. If the modules which are subject
to the medical device regulations are intended for use in combination
with other modules of the whole software structure, other devices or
equipment, the whole combination, including the connection system, must
be safe and must not impair the specified performances of the modules
which are subject to the medical device regulations.27
8. Consideration of changes to an MDSW Manufacturers shall evaluate the
potential impact of any changes to the function, intended use, essential
design, and manufacturing characteristics on the software's
qualification as MDSW and its classification (including the
classification of the combination of the MDSW with another medical
device). It is to be noted that a change to or the addition of
functionality to a software may lead it to be qualified as MDSW, or a
revision of the classification of the MDSW. Similarly, a module that is
added to a software might be qualified as a MDSW on its own. When
determining the risk class of a combination of a modified MDSW and a
medical device, the intended purpose and functionality of that (new)
combination must be considered. Note: For all MDSW, the manufacturer
shall ensure safety and performance throughout the lifecycle of the
software, through a continuous process of clinical and/or performance
evaluation and risk management.
9. Annex I: Illustrative examples of qualification of software used in
the healthcare environment Software for a medical purpose is rapidly
evolving. Thus, the list of examples provided below is not exhaustive.
The examples have been drafted in light of today's state of the art, in
order to give the reader a better understanding of the application of
the principles set out in the guideline. The Manual on borderline and
classification in the Community regulatory framework for medical devices
contains many examples related to qualification of software and apps,
under the current 27
i.e. general safety and performance requirements 14.1 of EU MDR 2017/745
and 13.1 of EU IVDR 2017/746
Page 18 of 28
Directives28. The Manual is currently under revision for adaptation to
MDRs. In light of the technological progress, further examples will be
regularly published in both the Manual and in this guidance. a) Hospital
Information Systems Hospital Information Systems mean, in this context,
systems that support the process of patient management. Typically they
are intended for patient admission, for scheduling patient appointments,
for insurance and billing purposes. These Hospital Information Systems
are not qualified as medical devices. However, they may be used with
additional modules, as described hereafter. These modules might be
qualified in their own right as medical devices. b) Decision Support
Software In general, these are computer based tools which combine
general medical information databases and algorithms with
patient-specific data. They are intended to provide healthcare
professionals and/or users with recommendations for diagnosis,
prognosis, monitoring and treatment of individual patients. Based on
Figure 1, they are qualified as medical devices. •
Radiotherapy treatment planning systems29 are intended to calculate the
dosage of ionizing irradiation to be applied to a specific patient. They
are considered to control, monitor or directly influence the source of
ionizing radiation and are qualified as medical devices.
•
Drug planning systems (e.g. chemotherapy) are intended to calculate the
drug dosage to be administered to a specific patient and therefore are
qualified as medical devices.
•
Computer Aided Detection systems are intended to provide information
that may suggest or exclude medical conditions are qualified as medical
devices (MDSW). For example, such systems would be able to automatically
analyse x-ray images or interpret ECGs.
c) Information Systems Information Systems that are intended only to
transfer, store, convert, format, archive data are not qualified as
medical devices in themselves. However, they may be used with additional
modules which maybe qualified in their own right as medical devices
(MDSW). c.1.) Electronic Patient Record Systems Electronic patient
record systems are intended to store and transfer electronic patient
records. They archive all kinds of documents and data related to a
specific patient. The electronic patient records should not be qualified
as a medical device, i.e. an electronic patient record that simply
replaces a patient's paper file does not meet the definition of a
medical device. The modules used with electronic patient record system
modules that might be qualified in their own right as medical devices
(MDSW) are for example: • An image viewer with functionality for
diagnosis based on digital images; • A medication module

planning systems"

c.1.1.) Clinical Information Systems -- CIS / Patient Data Management
Systems -- PDMS A CIS/PDMS is a software-based system primarily intended
to store and transfer patient information generated in association with
the patient's intensive care treatment (e.g. intensive care units).
Usually the system contains information such as patient identification,
vital intensive care parameters and other documented clinical
observations. These CIS/PDMS are not qualified as medical devices.
Modules that are intended to provide additional information that
contributes to diagnosis, therapy and follow-up (e.g. generate alarms)
are qualified as medical devices. c.1.2.) Pre-hospital
Electrocardiograph (ECG) System A system for managing pre-hospital ECG
is a software-based system intended for ambulance services to store and
transfer information from patients to a doctor at remote location.
Usually the system contains information about patient identification,
vital parameters and other documented clinical observations. These
Pre-hospital Electrocardiograph (ECG) Systems are not qualified as
medical devices. Modules that create and provide new patient treatment
information to the paramedics or to the doctor at a remote location to
start the patient's treatment while the patient is being transported are
qualified as medical devices. c.1.3.) Picture Archive Communication
System (PACS) The Manual on Borderline and Classification in the
Community Regulatory Framework for Medical Devices addresses the
qualification of PACS.30 The transposition of this Directive Guidance to
the Regulations is currently underway and will be published at
https://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/medical-devices/new-regulations/guidance_en
d) Communication Systems The healthcare sector uses communication
systems (e.g. email systems, mobile telecommunication systems, video
communication systems, paging, etc.) to transfer electronic information.
Different types of messages are sent such as prescription, referrals,
images, patient records, etc. Most of the communication systems handle
types of messages other than medical information. This communication
system is intended for general purposes, and is used for transferring
both medical and non-medical information. Communication systems are
normally based on software for general purposes, and do not fall within
the definition of a medical device. Communication system modules might
be used with other modules that might be qualified in their own right as
medical devices (MDSW). A software module generating alarms based on the
monitoring and analysis of patient specific physiological parameters is
qualified as a medical device (MDSW). d.1) Telemedicine systems
Telemedicine Systems are intended to allow monitoring and/or delivery of
healthcare to patients at locations remote from where the healthcare
professional is located.
30

d.1.1.) Telesurgery Telesurgery is intended to conduct a surgical
procedure from a remote location. Virtual reality technology may be used
to support a remote surgeon to control a surgical robot performing the
surgical procedure. Telesurgery systems should be qualified as medical
devices according to Figure 2 of this document. Remote control software
used in combination with telesurgery robots is a software that drives or
influences the use of a medical device. Communication modules themselves
are not medical devices. Other modules that are intended to influence
the surgery procedure are qualified as medical devices (MDSW). e) Web
systems for monitoring of data A web system for the monitoring of
clinical data typically interacts with a medical device (e.g. implanted
devices or homecare devices), and uses a transmitter to send the
information over the internet, a landline telephone or a mobile network.
The information is collected and stored on a web server usually run by
an external party who is generally the manufacturer of the system. The
information can be reached by authorized health professionals or the
patient through an internet connection. •
Monitoring of performance of medical devices: Modules that are intended
to monitor the medical performance of medical devices fall under the
medical device regulations. This includes the clinical performance and
failures that could affect medical performance of the device. One
example of such a product is a web system for monitoring of active
implants such as pacemakers or Intra Cardiac Defibrillators (ICDs).
•
Monitoring of non-medical performance of medical devices Modules that
are intended to perform administrative monitoring of non-medical
performance of medical devices do not necessarily fall under the scope
of the medical devices regulations. Software for the monitoring of
medical devices in hospital systems for the purpose of maintenance and
repair.
f) In vitro diagnostic medical device software f.1.) Laboratory
Information Systems (LIS) and Work Area Managers (WAM) Laboratory
Information System (LIS) and Work Area Managers (WAM) mean, in this
context, systems that support the process from patient sample to patient
result. Typically, they have preanalytical functions for ordering,
sorting and distribution of test samples. The main task is the
management and validation of incoming information obtained from in vitro
diagnostic medical device analysers connected to the system, such as
calibration, quality control, product expiry and feedback (e.g.
retesting of samples needed) through interconnections with various
analytical instruments (technical and clinical validation). Finally the
post-analytical process allows communication of laboratory results,
statistics and optional reporting to external databases. The software
normally supports the following functions: • Ordering of laboratory
tests, samples with labels and sorting; • Technical and clinical
validation, connection to analytic instruments; • Laboratory results and
reports on paper, fax or electronic records that can be directly
returned to e.g. the ordering clinic's patient record; • Analytical
instruments can be interfaced with Hospital Information Systems (HIS),
Electronic Patient Record Systems, Infectious control databases, etc.
Page 21 of 28
Note: software intended to modify the representation of available in
vitro diagnostic medical device results is not considered an in vitro
diagnostic medical device, e.g. basic operations of arithmetic (e.g.
mean, conversion of units) and/or plotting of results in function of
time, and/or a comparison of the result to the limits of acceptance set
by the user. The results are available, readable and understandable
without the intervention of the software. Laboratory Information Systems
(LIS) and Work Area Managers (WAM) are not qualified as medical devices
in themselves. However, they may be used with additional modules. These
modules might be qualified in their own right as medical devices. A
module whose intended purpose is to assess the criticality of tests
required and to perform automatic reprioritisation of the order based on
patient data is qualified as a MDSW. f.2.) Expert system MDSW which is
intended to provide information within the scope of the in vitro
diagnostic medical devices definition by capturing and analysing
together one or multiple results obtained for one patient by means of in
vitro examination of body samples (possibly combined with information
from medical devices and non-medical devices). • •
•
MDSW that integrates genotype of multiple genes to predict risk a
disease or medical condition developing or recurring; MDSW that uses an
algorithm to characterise viral resistances to various drugs, based on a
nucleotide sequence generated by genotyping assays. This software serves
to generate new information (virus resistance profile) from available
information on the genotype of the virus; MDSW intended to be used in
microbiology for the identification of clinical isolates and/or the
detection of antimicrobial resistances.
Refer to Figure 2 of this guidance if data is obtained from both in
vitro diagnostic medical devices and medical devices. f.3.)
Interpretation of raw data In the case where MDSW is necessary to render
raw data, readable for the user, obtained from an in vitro diagnostic
medical device by means of in vitro examination of body samples, this
MDSW is to be considered driving or influencing the use of the in vitro
diagnostic medical device when it is specifically intended to be used
together with this in vitro diagnostic medical device to enable it to be
used in accordance with its intended purpose. MDSW intended for the
analysis and interpretation of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
reader optical density results, line patterns or spot patterns of a
blot. f.4.) Home care monitoring, wired or mobile Software intended for
archiving patient results or for transferring results obtained from in
vitro diagnostic medical devices from the home environment to the
healthcare provider is not an in vitro diagnostic medical device. The
results are available, readable and understandable by the user without
the intervention of the software. f.5.) Image Management System (IMS) An
IMS is a software-based system primarily intended to be networked with
digital pathology systems, e.g., whole slide scanners, scanning
microscopes, as well as LIS. It does not contain controls for the direct
operation of the digital pathology systems, and is intended to access,
display, annotate, manage, store, archive and share collections of
digitised patient images. IMS may be configured to
Page 22 of 28
provide limited or extensive capabilities to further visualise or
analyse patient images acquired from networked digital pathology
systems. An IMS only used for viewing, archiving and transmitting images
are not considered medical devices in themselves. However, these IMS may
be used with additional modules that might be qualified in their own
right as medical devices (MDSW). IMS that incorporate functions to
support post-processing of images for diagnostics purposes, e.g., image
processing functions which alter image data or complex quantitative
functions to aid in diagnosis, are qualified as MDSW.

10. Annex II - Qualification examples of Medical Device Software (MDSW)
according to Figures 1 and 2 Figure 1 - Example 1: A software module
which runs on an in vitro diagnostic medical device instrument and
tracks how the laboratory is performing in real-time on key operational
metrics such as test volumes, turnaround times, pending tests, and
quality control. Its intent is to improve a laboratory's operations by
providing real-time monitoring of performance metrics that can drive
change management and continuous improvement initiatives within the lab.
The software is configurable so that customers can choose the metrics on
which they would like to focus. Qualification: Step 1 is concluded with
a "yes" as the software is a product which uses a set of instructions
(or algorithm) to process input data and create output data. Step 2
determines that the software is not an MDR Annex XVI device, nor is it
an accessory for a medical device, nor a software driving or influencing
the use of a medical device. Step 3 is answered "yes" since the software
is doing more than storage, archival, communication or simple search of
information. Step 4 is answered "no" as the software does not perform
this action for the benefit of individual patients. The conclusion is
that the software does not fall under the Medical Devices Regulations.
This is appropriate since the software is intended to be a Laboratory
Information Systems (LIS), which is not considered a medical device.
Figure 2 - Example 2: MDSW intended to generate a risk score in order to
trigger care processes to help reduce ICU transfers, readmissions,
adverse events and length of stay. The risk score by default includes
respiratory rate, heart rate, blood pressure and SpO2, but a user can
configure it to include other parameters, including in vitro diagnostic
medical device results. Qualification: In decision Step 1, the MDSW can
be understood to meet criteria (a), (f) and (h), it is therefore
answered "yes". Step 2 is answered with a "No" as an in vitro diagnostic
medical device result may be included in the in the calculation. Step 3
directs the significance of the medical device derived information as
driving the intended purpose, resulting in the qualification of the
software as an MD MDSW (as the data received from the in vitro
diagnostic medical device is not deemed decisive for the overall
calculation result (output) achieved by the MDSW) Figure 2 - Example 3:
A MDSW algorithm intended to provide information on the statistical
predisposition for Down syndrome (Trisomy 21) and Edwards syndrome
(Trisomy 18) in the first and second trimesters of pregnancy. 31 The
MDSW analyses input data from various in vitro diagnostic medical device
assays32 as well as, ultrasound measurements of the nasal bone or neck
fold. The MDSW provides clinicians/obstetricians with a risk factor
score for a foetus's likelihood of having genetic mutations in the first
or second trimester of pregnancy. The risk score suggests whether or not
additional diagnostic testing is needed to confirm the genetic mutations
of Trisomy 21, Trisomy 18.33 Qualification: Step 1 can be answered "yes"
as the software bears a medical purpose and fulfils the definition of
MDSW. The MDSW meets criteria (c) as it provides information according
to the in vitro 31
The software can also detect neural tube defects (NTD) in the second
trimester as well as the risk for Patau's syndrome (Trisomy 13). 32 AFP
(LKAP, L2KAP), Unconjugated Estriol (LKUE3, L2KUE3), hCG (LKCG, L2KCG),
free β-hCG (LKFB, L2KFB), PAPP A (LKPC, L2KPC) 33 or neural tube defects
and Trisomy 13

diagnostic medical devices definition. Decision step 2 is answered "no"
as an imaging measurement is included in the calculation. Step 3 is
answered "yes" as the intended purpose is substantially driven by in
vitro diagnostic medical device data resulting in the qualification of
the software as an IVD MDSW (as the data received from the in vitro
diagnostic medical devices (markers) are deemed decisive for the overall
calculation result (output) achieved by the MDSW). Figure 2- Example 4:
A bioinformatics MDSW intended to analyse digital Next Generation
Sequencing (NGS) raw data coming from sequenced patient's cancer
genomes. It allows the detection and visualisation of somatic genome
alterations (such as substitutions, small insertions and deletions
(indels), copy number alterations, and genomic rearrangements) across a
selected number of genes. Additionally, it is also capable of
determining genomic signatures* (such as microsatellite instability
[MSI] and/or tumour mutational burden [TMB]). The types of somatic
genome alterations and genomic signatures detected depend on the test
chosen. The MDSW assists the user in identifying and visualising genomic
alterations and is intended to identify somatic genome alterations to
support diagnosis and treatment decisions. Qualification: Decision step
1 is concluded with a "yes" as the MDSW is intended for analysing
congenital data to provide information on the predisposition to a
medical condition or disease, thus meeting criteria (b) and (c) laid out
in the decision step. As the MDSW processes data coming only from in
vitro diagnostic medical devices into the calculation, then the software
is qualified as an IVD MDSW according to Step 2.

Annex III - Usability of the IMDRF risk classification framework in the
context of the MDR 34
The table below, which is intended for illustrative purposes only, may
provide operators placing MDSW on the EU market with some useful
indicative orientation on the risk class applicable to their products as
a result of the application of Rule 11 a of the MDR. Note: MDR 2017/745
Sub-rule 11(a), point i., referring above to MDR class III, aligns with
IMDRF risk category IV. Sub-rule 11(a), point ii.,, referring above to
MDR class IIb, aligns with IMDRF risk category III products mentioned in
section 7.2 of the mentioned IMDRF document. The IMDRF risk category II
and IMDRF risk category I products are classified as MDR class IIa as
per Rule 11. This table does not take into account MDSW which is Class
I.

order to classify IVD MDSW. MDCG Guidance on Classification of IVDs
should also be considered.

12. Annex IV -- Classification examples The examples are provided for
guidance purposes only, to illustrate how a particular rule may be
applied to a device. The indicated classification in the example is not
a confirmation of the final classification of the device, as other rules
might also be considered. Moreover, the proposed classification reflects
the specific intended purpose, or the healthcare context or situation,
in which the device is used as described in the example itself. Any
change to the intended purpose or the healthcare context/situation in
which that same device is used might result in a different risk class. •
MDSW intended to perform diagnosis by means of image analysis for making
treatment decisions in patients with acute stroke should be classified
as class III under Rule 11(a) - IMDRF Risk Category IV.i as the
healthcare situation (stroke) is critical and the significance of the
information is "treat or diagnose". • Cognitive therapy MDSW that
includes a diagnostic function which is intended to feed back to the
software to determine follow-up therapy, e.g. software adapts treatment
of depression based on diagnostic feedback, should be in class III per
Rule 22. When a specialist determines the necessary cognitive therapy
based on the outcome provided by the MDSW, the MDSW would be classified
as class IIa per Rule 11(a). - IMDRF Risk Category II.ii as the
healthcare situation is serious and the significance of the information
is to "drive clinical management". • Medical devices including MDSW
intended to be used for continuous surveillance of vital physiological
processes in anaesthesia, intensive care or emergency care should be
classified as class IIb per (Rule 11(b)). • Medical devices, including
MDSW intended to monitor physiological processes that are not considered
to be vital, and devices intended to be used to obtain readings of vital
physiological signals in routine check-ups including monitoring at home
should be classified as class IIa (Rule 11(b)). • A mobile app intended
to analyse a user's heartbeat, detect abnormalities and inform a
physician accordingly should be classified as class IIb per Rule 11(a),
if the information provided by the software is intended to guide the
physician in the diagnosis. - IMDRF Risk Category III.i as the
information drives clinical management. • Diagnostic MDSW intended for
scoring depression based on inputted data on a patient's symptoms (e.g.
mood, anxiety) should be classified as class IIb under Rule 11(a), -
(IMDRF Risk Category III.ii) as the healthcare situation (depression) is
serious and the significance of the information is "diagnosis"). •
Ambulatory respiratory ventilation systems MDSW intended for long-term
use (e.g. at home) that alert the user/operator to any disconnection or
deviation to the programmed respiratory volume should be classified as
class IIb per Rule 9. • Active devices, such as electronic thermometers
and stethoscopes, which include MDSW intended for direct diagnosis may
be classified as class IIa per Rule 10, third indent since body
temperature and heart rate are considered decisive information for
diagnosis (implementing rule 3.7), where the nature of the variations of
these parameters would not result in immediate danger to the patient. •
MDSW intended to rank therapeutic suggestions for a health care
professional based on patient history, imaging test results, and patient
characteristics, for example, MDSW that lists and ranks all available
chemotherapy options for BRCA-positive individuals, should be classified
as class IIa per Rule 11(a)
Page 27 of 28
-
IMDRF Risk Category II.i as it informs clinical management for cancer, a
critical disease.
• MDSW app intended to support conception by calculating the user's
fertility status based on a validated statistical algorithm. The user
inputs health data including basal body temperature (BBT) and
menstruation days to track and predict ovulation. The fertility status
of the current day is reflected by one of three indicator lights: red
(fertile), green (infertile) or yellow (learning phase/cycle
fluctuation). This MDSW app should be classified as class I per Rule
11c.

1. Purpose The purpose of this guidance is to provide a framework for
the determination of the appropriate level of CLINICAL EVIDENCE required
for MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE (MDSW) to fulfil the requirements set out in
Regulation (EU) 2017/745 -- Medical Devices Regulation (MDR) and
Regulation (EU) 2017/746 -- In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices
Regulation (IVDR).1 In order to promote global convergence, this
document takes into account certain concepts outlined in International
Medical Device Regulators Forum (IMDRF) guidance documents (such as
N41).2
2. Scope This guidance should be applied to MDSW. For the purpose of
this guidance, MDSW is software that is intended to be used, alone or in
combination, for a purpose as specified in the definition of a "medical
device" in the medical devices regulation or in vitro diagnostic medical
devices regulation. It should be noted that software can be associated3
with another medical device, by driving or influencing its use. The
guideline MDCG 2019-11 clarifies that software which is driving or
influencing is covered by the medical devices regulations4 either as a
part/component of a device or as an accessory for a medical device.
Software developers should refer to MDCG 2019-11 for guidance on the
appropriate qualification and classification of software prior to such
software being introduced into the market. The same principles of
CLINICAL EVALUATION (MDR) / PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (IVDR) apply to all
MDSW. Conceptually, the following models of software can be understood
(whereas combinations may be possible, refer to Table 1): a) Software
for which the manufacturer claims a specific medical intended purpose.
Such software has a CLINICAL BENEFIT and requires CLINICAL EVIDENCE
within its own conformity assessment. b) Software for which the
manufacturer does not claim any medical intended purpose. Such software
is intended to drive or influence a medical device. The CLINICAL
EVIDENCE is provided within the context of the driven or influenced
device and is therefore out of the scope of this document. It should be
recognised that the concept of a CLINICAL BENEFIT for MDSW may deviate
from that which applies in the case of pharmaceuticals or other medical
devices, since the benefit of MDSW may lie in providing accurate medical
information on patients, where appropriate, assessed against medical
information obtained through the use of other diagnostic options and
technologies, whereas the final clinical outcome for the patient is
dependent on further diagnostic and/or therapeutic options which could
be available.

Depending on the device in question, the level of Clinical Evidence may
differ and shall be assessed on a case by case basis.

EVALUATION (IVDR) is required for each foreseen and clinically viable
software -- device combination. Note 2: Out of scope of this guidance
(See MDCG 2019-11 for examples).
3. Background Article 61 (1) of the MDR and Article 56 (1) of the IVDR
state the following: 'The manufacturer shall specify and justify the
level of CLINICAL EVIDENCE necessary to demonstrate conformity with the
relevant general safety and performance requirements. That level of
CLINICAL EVIDENCE shall be appropriate in view of the characteristics of
the device and its intended purpose.' Article 2 (51) of the MDR and
Article 2 (36) of the IVDR define 'CLINICAL EVIDENCE' as: 'clinical data
and CLINICAL EVALUATION (MDR) / PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (IVDR) results
pertaining to a device of a sufficient amount and quality to allow a
qualified assessment of whether the device is safe and achieves the
intended CLINICAL BENEFIT(S), when used as intended by the
manufacturer.' In order to provide guidance relating to the level of
CLINICAL EVIDENCE required for MDSW and as set out in recital (5) of the
MDR and IVDR, this guidance takes into account internationally converged
principles adopted by an international group of regulators, IMDRF
(http://www.imdrf.org). Adoption of these principles provides European
regulators an initial framework when further developing MDR/
IVDRspecific regulatory approaches and expectations for regulatory
oversight. While this document describes a converged approach to
CLINICAL EVALUATION (MDR) / PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (IVDR) for MDSW, it
should be read in conjunction with other documents that aim to provide
Page 4 of 21
horizontal guidance for the CLINICAL EVALUATION of medical devices or
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION of in vitro diagnostic medical devices.5 Note:
Please be advised that this document is subject to revision upon the
publication of the aforementioned horizontal guidance. Clinical
expertise and judgments are required at every step of the CLINICAL
EVALUATION (MDR) / PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (IVDR), including literature
search and appraisal. Each indication and claimed CLINICAL BENEFIT that
is part of the intended purpose should be assessed individually and have
the supporting CLINICAL EVIDENCE. Systematic and explicit approach for
the appraisal of supporting data allows achieving confident,
scientifically substantiated conclusions and facilitates transparency of
these judgments.

CLINICAL BENEFIT
Article 2 (53) MDR defines CLINICAL BENEFIT as the positive impact of a
device on the health of an individual, expressed in the terms of a
meaningful, measurable, patient-relevant clinical outcome(s), including
outcome(s) related to diagnosis, or a positive impact on patient
management or public health; whereas Article 2 (37) IVDR defines
CLINICAL BENEFIT as the positive impact of a device related to its
function, such as that of screening, monitoring, diagnosis or aid to
diagnosis of patients, or a positive impact on patient management or
public health.6 Source: EU 2017/745 (MDR), Article 2 (53); EU 2017/746

CLINICAL DATA
(MDR) Information concerning safety or performance that is generated
from the use of a device and is sourced from the following: - clinical
investigation(s) of the device concerned, - clinical investigation(s) or
other studies reported in scientific literature, of a device for which
equivalence to the device in question can be demonstrated, - reports
published in peer reviewed scientific literature on other clinical
experience of either the device in question or a device for which
equivalence to the device in question can be demonstrated, - clinically
relevant information coming from post-market surveillance, in particular
the post-market clinical follow-up; Source: EU 2017/745 (MDR)
(IVDR) Clinical Data, in particular: - from relevant peer-reviewed
scientific literature and available consensus expert opinions or
positions from relevant professional associations relating to the
safety, performance, clinical benefits to patients, design
characteristics, scientific validity, clinical performance and intended
purpose of the device and/or of equivalent or similar devices; or -
other relevant clinical data available relating to the safety,
scientific validity, clinical performance, clinical benefits to
patients, design characteristics and intended purpose of similar
devices, including details of their similarities and differences with
the device in question - clinically relevant information coming from
post-market surveillance, in particular the post-market performance
follow-up; Source: Adopted from EU 2017/746 (IVDR) Annex XIV (2.4) and
Annex VII (4.10) and (4.11)
6 IVDR recital (64) states : It should be recognised that the concept of
clinical benefit for in vitro diagnostic medical devices is
fundamentally different from that which applies in the case of
pharmaceuticals or of therapeutic medical devices, since the benefit of
in vitro diagnostic medical devices lies in providing accurate medical
information on patients, where appropriate, assessed against medical
information obtained through the use of other diagnostic options and
technologies, whereas the final clinical outcome for the patient is
dependent on further diagnostic and/or therapeutic options which could
be available.

4. General principles of the MDSW CLINICAL EVALUATION (MDR) /
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (IVDR) process 4.1.
Introduction
CLINICAL EVALUATION (MDR) / PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (IVDR) is an ongoing
process, conducted throughout the life cycle of a MDSW. It is a
structured, transparent, iterative and continuous process which is part
of the quality management system for a device. Software that qualifies
as a MD or an IVD is subject to the same general CLINICAL EVALUATION
(MDR) / PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (IVDR) principles, laid down in the
applicable guidelines and regulatory documents, as other MDs/ IVDs, such
as: -
Establishing and maintaining a CLINICAL EVALUATION (MDR) / PERFORMANCE
EVALUATION (IVDR) plan and criteria applied to generate the necessary
CLINICAL EVIDENCE based on the characteristics of the device;
-
Identification of the relevant data pertaining to performance and/ or
safety of the device and any remaining unaddressed issues or gaps in the
data;
-
Appraisal of the relevant data in terms of quality and its contribution
to the CLINICAL EVALUATION (MDR) / PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (IVDR);
-
Analysis of the available data and its relevance with regard to
demonstrating conformity with the relevant General Safety and
Performance Requirements (GSPRs);
-
Documenting the relevant data, their assessment and the CLINICAL
EVIDENCE derived therefrom, in the CLINICAL EVALUATION (MDR) /
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (IVDR) report;
-
Updating the CLINICAL EVALUATION (MDR) / PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (IVDR)
and its documentation throughout the life cycle of the MDSW concerned
with data obtained from implementation of the manufacturer's Post
Market Clinical Follow-up / Post Market Performance Follow-up (PMCF
/PMPF) plan.
These methodological principles are depicted in Figure 1.
Figure 1 Overview of the stages of the CLINICAL EVALUATION (MDR) /
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (IVDR)
Page 9 of 21
The requirements for CLINICAL EVALUATION and PERFORMANCE EVALUATION are
outlined in Article 61 of the MDR (including Annex XIV) and Article 56
of the IVDR (including Annex XIII), respectively. While the definition
of CLINICAL EVALUATION in the MDR and PERFORMANCE EVALUATION in the IVDR
are not identical (see section 0), there is a shared expectation for
providing sufficient CLINICAL EVIDENCE to demonstrate conformity with
relevant GSPRs under the normal conditions of the device's intended use.
CLINICAL EVIDENCE should be sufficient and appropriate in view of the
characteristics of the device, clinical risks and its intended purpose.
The level of CLINICAL EVIDENCE necessary should be specified and
justified by the manufacturer. Three key components should be taken into
account when compiling CLINICAL EVIDENCE for every MDSW (Figure 1), and
each is described below in further detail. VALID CLINICAL ASSOCIATION /
SCIENTIFIC VALIDITY is understood as the extent to which, the MDSW's
output (e.g. concept, conclusion, calculations) based on the inputs and
algorithms selected, is associated with the targeted physiological state
or clinical condition. This association should be well founded or
clinically accepted (e.g. existence of a scientific framework or
sufficient level of evidence as further elaborated in section 4.2 of
this document). The VALID CLINICAL ASSOCIATION / SCIENTIFIC VALIDITY of
a MDSW should demonstrate that it corresponds to the clinical situation,
condition, indication or parameter defined in the intended purpose of
the MDSW. NOTE: The VALID CLINICAL ASSOCIATION / SCIENTIFIC VALIDITY
seeks to establish that there are sound scientific principles
underpinning the use of the MDSW in question. The information provided
for the establishment of the VALID CLINICAL ASSOCIATION / SCIENTIFIC
VALIDITY should put forward the case that the MDSW has an association
with a clinical condition or physiological state. This association may
not always be readily established. Thus, the CLINICAL PERFORMANCE can
serve as an additional input to the VALID CLINICAL ASSOCIATION/
SCIENTIFIC VALIDITY from a clinical perspective for the specific
intended purpose (see Annex I). Example: MDSW that detects heart
arrhythmia by analysing auscultation sound obtained by a digital
stethoscope requires demonstrating VALID CLINICAL ASSOCIATION of the
association between abnormal cardiac sounds and heart arrhythmia.
Evidence supporting VALID CLINICAL ASSOCIATION / SCIENTIFIC VALIDITY can
be generated e.g. through literature research, professional guidelines,
proof of concept studies, or manufacturer's own clinical
investigations/clinical performance studies. Validation of the TECHNICAL
PERFORMANCE / ANALYTICAL PERFORMANCE is the demonstration of the MDSW's
ability to accurately, reliably and precisely generate the intended
output, from the input data. Evidence supporting TECHNICAL PERFORMANCE /
ANALYTICAL PERFORMANCE can be generated through verification and
validation activities, e.g. unit-level, integration, and system testing
or by generating new evidence through use of curated databases, curated
registries, reference databases or use of previously collected patient
data. Validation of the CLINICAL PERFORMANCE is the demonstration of a
MDSW's ability to yield clinically relevant output in accordance with
the intended purpose. The clinical relevance of a MDSW's output is a
positive impact
Page 10 of 21
-
on the health of an individual expressed in terms of measurable,
patient-relevant clinical outcome(s), including outcome(s) related to
diagnosis, prediction of risk, prediction of treatment response(s), or
-
related to its function, such as that of screening, monitoring,
diagnosis or aid to diagnosis of patients, or
-
on patient management or public health.
Evidence supporting CLINICAL PERFORMANCE can be generated by testing the
MDSW under evaluation, or an equivalent device, in the target population
and for the intended use. The applied methodology should be appropriate
in light of the device characteristics and intended purpose and may
include pre-clinical testing, a clinical investigation or a clinical
performance study. Specifically, for MDSW not claiming CLINICAL BENEFITS
that can be specified through measurable, patient-relevant clinical
outcome(s), clinically relevant outputs are achieved through
demonstrated predictable and reliable use and USABILITY (please refer to
section 4.2 of this document). In addition, CLINICAL EVALUATION or
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION of MDSW must consider the benefitrisk ratio in
light of the STATE-OF-THE-ART related to practice of medicine for
diagnosis, treatment or patient management. It is further expected that
the assessment of MDSW considers all components of the CLINICAL
EVALUATION (MDR) / PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (IVDR) (see Figure 1 and Annex
0). The three components described above do not represent a distinct
stepwise approach but rather portray a methodological principle for the
generation of CLINICAL EVIDENCE. To determine and justify the level of
CLINICAL EVIDENCE, both amount and quality of supporting data should be
evaluated. This assessment may be guided by the following non-exhaustive
questions: Sufficient amount -
Does the data support the intended use, indications, target groups,
clinical claims and contraindications?
-
Have the clinical risks and analytical performance/ clinical performance
been investigated?
-
Have relevant MDSW's characteristics, such as the data input and output,
the applied algorithms or type of interconnection been considered when
generating the data to support the performance of the device?
-
What is the grade of innovation/ history on the market (how big is the
body of scientific evidence)?
-
Other, as applicable.
Sufficient quality -
Were the type and the design of the study/ test appropriate to meet the
research objectives?
-
Was the data set appropriate and actual (state of the art)?
-
Was the statistical approach appropriate to reach a valid conclusion?
-
Were all ethical, legal and regulatory considerations/ requirements
taken into account?
-
Is there any conflict of interest?

Other, as applicable.
4.2.
Determination of the valid clinical association / scientific validity
In the first step, the manufacturer should verify the association
between the output of the MDSW (based on the inputs and algorithms
selected) and the targeted physiological/ clinical condition, clinical
situation or clinical parameter, as defined in the intended purpose of
the MDSW. MDSW may include a multitude of clinical features governed by
its intended purpose which require individual assessment. This
association should be clinically accepted or well founded, which means
accepted by the broad medical community and/or described in scientific
(peer-reviewed) literature. VALID CLINICAL ASSOCIATION/ SCIENTIFIC
VALIDITY can be demonstrated through the use of existing CLINICAL
PERFORMANCE DATA while taking into account the generally acknowledged
STATE-OF-THE-ART. VALID CLINICAL ASSOCIATION / SCIENTIFIC VALIDITY may
further be demonstrated by the creation of new CLINICAL PERFORMANCE DATA
in the cases where existing data is not sufficient. For example, as a
result of a gap analysis, the manufacturer could conclude that
additional data may be required. Examples of existing data (in no
particular order) -
Technical standards Professional medical society guidelines Systematic
scientific literature review CLINICAL INVESTIGATIONs/ CLINICAL
PERFORMANCE STUDIES Published CLINICAL DATA (e.g. Summary of Safety and
Clinical Performance (SSCP) / Summary of Safety and Performance (SSP),
Registries and databases from authorities)
Examples of generating new evidence (in no particular order) -
Secondary data analysis (Analysis of real-world data) Perform CLINICAL
INVESTIGATION / CLINICAL PERFORMANCE STUDY
4.3.
Technical Performance /Analytical Performance
The manufacturer should verify that the MDSW reliably, accurately and
consistently meets the intended purpose in real-world usage. The
relevant performance characteristics, as part of the GSPRs and linked to
the analytical and / or clinical features, should be supported by
evidence generated during verification and validation activities as part
of good manufacturing practices for software, or by generating new
evidence through the use of curated databases, curated registries,
reference databases or use of previously collected patient data.
Page 12 of 21
TECHNICAL PERFORMANCE / ANALYTICAL PERFORMANCE is confirmed by the
examination and provision of objective evidence that the MDSW
specifications conform to user needs and intended uses, and that the
requirements implemented can be consistently fulfilled.7 For example,
performance verification and validation in the intended computing8 and
use environments9,10 can be characterised by the demonstration of -
availability, confidentiality, integrity, reliability, accuracy
(resulting from trueness and precision), analytical sensitivity, limit
of detection, limit of quantitation, analytical specificity, linearity,
cut-off value(s), measuring interval (range), GENERALISABILITY, expected
data rate or quality, absence of inacceptable cybersecurity
vulnerabilities, HUMAN FACTORS ENGINEERING.
Identification of gaps during the validation of the TECHNICAL
PERFORMANCE /ANALYTICAL PERFORMANCE could require generation of new
evidence, for example, to demonstrate generalisability with real-life
datasets or to extend the usability evaluation to omitted user groups.
4.4.
Clinical Performance
For the validation of a MDSW's CLINICAL PERFORMANCE, the manufacturer
should demonstrate that the MDSW has been tested for the intended
use(s), target population(s), use condition(s), operating- and use
environment(s) and with all intended user group(s). Section 4.1 of this
document further provides context that validation of CLINICAL
PERFORMANCE includes the assessment of clinical safety, effectiveness,
performance and can support the demonstration of CLINICAL BENEFIT.
Validation of the CLINICAL PERFORMANCE should be considered at each
change of the software to a new release. If no validation is performed,
a justification should be stated in the technical documentation. With a
validation of CLINICAL PERFORMANCE, it is demonstrated that users can
achieve clinically relevant outputs through predictable and reliable use
of the MDSW.
7 Derived from Source: GHTF/SG3/N18:2010. 8 Computing environment: e.g.,
hardware, memory size, processing unit, time zone, network
infrastructure) under which the
software is to perform. 9 Use environment: actual conditions and setting
in which users interact with the medical device. 10 Example on operating
environments with distinct requirements are cloud or remote networks.
Page 13 of 21
The manufacturer should consider the intended use(s), indication(s),
desired clinical output(s) expressed as claims, leading to expected
CLINICAL BENEFITs as part of the CLINICAL PERFORMANCE validation. A MDSW
may have multiple features with only some features claiming a specific
CLINICAL BENEFIT. CLINICAL PERFORMANCE is only applicable to those
features. Since MDSW can be modular in nature, validation of the
CLINICAL PERFORMANCE is also permissible on module level when the
functionality of the modules is independent of the other modules. This
would allow the confirmation of a continuous benefit / risk
acceptability only for the MDSW modules that have changed. In cases
where the final combination of modules changes product indications and
intended purposes, the performance of that final product configuration
should also be evaluated. Validation of the CLINICAL PERFORMANCE can be
characterised by the demonstration of applicable CLINICAL DATA to the
MDSW in question, such as (non-exhaustive): -
clinical/ diagnostic sensitivity, clinical/ diagnostic specificity,
positive predictive value, negative predictive value, number needed to
treat (average number of patients that need to be diagnosed/ treated in
order to have an impact on one person), number needed to harm (number of
patients that need to be diagnosed/ treated in order have an adverse
effect on one patient), positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood
ratio, odds ratio, USABILITY/ user interface, confidence interval(s).
CLINICAL DATA can be obtained by one or multiple methods such as those
referred to in GHTF/SG5/N7:2012 and IMDRF/SaMD WG/N41FINAL:2017. In
addition to the considerations above, CLINICAL EVALUATION of class III
and implantable devices (MDR), shall include data from a CLINICAL
INVESTIGATION unless the conditions of Article 61(4), (5) or (6) of the
MDR have been fulfilled. For MDSW falling under the IVDR, the evaluation
of clinical performance requires the carrying out of clinical
performance studies regardless of the classification of the device,
unless due justification is provided for relying on other sources of
clinical performance data. Relevant common specifications should be
taken into account.
4.4.1. Clinical investigations and clinical performance studies The
practical and achievable benefits of a CLINICAL INVESTIGATION / CLINICAL
PERFORMANCE STUDY should be considered as part of determining what data
are needed for demonstrating the safety and performance of a new or
modified MDSW. The investigation or study should account for potential
risks, should follow appropriate ethical requirements, and should be
compliant with all relevant legal and regulatory requirements.
Page 14 of 21
MDSW has specific characteristics that should be considered when setting
up a clinical investigation or clinical performance study. If the MDSW
is used for the determination of a patient's future state (e.g.
predisposition, prognosis, prediction) or if the output of the MDSW
impacts clinical outcomes (e.g. treatment efficacy) or patient
management decisions, then a prospective study may be required as part
of the device's CLINICAL EVALUATION (MDR) / PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
(IVDR). In other situations, retrospective analysis may be more
appropriate to generate the necessary data to support compliance with
the GSPRs, as there is no impact on patient management and the research
does not introduce any risks to the patients. Such an approach is only
possible under condition that there is an adequate access to data sets
of sufficient amount and quality and obtained from the target
population. Formal requirements of MDR Articles 62 (1), 74 and 82 need
to be met as far as appropriate for pre-market retrospective studies of
MDSW falling under the MDR.
4.4.2. Where demonstration of conformity based on clinical data is not
deemed appropriate In line with the provisions of MDR Article 61 (1) and
IVDR Article 56(1), the level of CLINICAL EVIDENCE required should be
appropriate in view of the device claims and characteristics. For
medical devices, where the demonstration of conformity with GSPRs based
on clinical data is not deemed appropriate (MDR Article 61 (10)), the
manufacturer shall duly substantiate in the technical documentation why
it is adequate to demonstrate conformity based on the results of
non-clinical testing methods alone, including PERFORMANCE EVALUATION,
bench testing and preclinical evaluation, and USABILITY assessment. The
justification must be based on the output of the risk management
process. This should include an evaluation of clinical STATE-OF-THE-ART,
including alternative diagnostic and treatment options, including those
identified from literature, and an appraisal of their relevance to the
device under evaluation. The device / body interaction, the CLINICAL
PERFORMANCEs intended, and the claims of the manufacturer should be
specifically considered. A CLINICAL EVALUATION (MDR) is still required,
and the above information and evidence-based justification should be
presented in the clinical evaluation report. Similarly for IVDs, where
due to specific device characteristics, demonstration of conformity with
GSPRs based on clinical data is not deemed appropriate, a PERFORMANCE
EVALUATION (IVDR) is still required and a justification shall be
provided and documented in the Performance Evaluation Plan and the
corresponding Performance Evaluation Report.
4.5.
Final analysis and conclusion of the clinical evaluation (MDR) /
performance evaluation (IVDR)
The manufacturer should compile evidence, perform the benefit-risk
analysis and document the CLINICAL or PERFORMANCE EVALUATION and its
output in the CLINICAL EVALUATION (MDR) / PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (IVDR)
report.
4.6.
Continuous update of the clinical evaluation (MDR) / performance
evaluation (IVDR)
The safety, effectiveness and performance of the MDSW should be actively
and continuously monitored by the manufacturer.
Page 15 of 21
Such data may include, but is not limited to post-market information
such as complaints, PMCF/ PMPF data, REAL-WORLD PERFORMANCE data, direct
end-user feedback or newly published research / guidelines and should be
subject to the CLINICAL EVALUATION (MDR) / PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (IVDR)
principles depicted in Figure 1. The unique level of connectivity of
MDSW facilitates access to REAL-WORLD PERFORMANCE data, which can be
used for multiple purposes, including, but not limited to -
timely detection and correction of malfunctions; detection of systematic
misuse; understanding user interactions; to conduct ongoing monitoring
of CLINICAL PERFORMANCE; to improve effectiveness; develop the claims in
the CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN (MDR) or future releases.
MDSW can be released for CE marking with initially claimed and validated
CLINICAL BENEFITS. Monitoring of REAL-WORLD PERFORMANCE data can help
formulate hypotheses about future MDSW functionalities and intended
use(s).

to develop a CLINICAL EVALUATION / PERFORMANCE EVALUATION strategy. The
strategy presented in each example is not a confirmation of the pathway

reflects the specific intended purpose, or the healthcare context or
situation, in which the device is used as described in the example

situation in which that same device is used might result in a different
approach. Data source Peer-reviewed, relevant scientific literature
Examples - Existing data from studies conducted with the subject device
or equivalent device
CLINICAL INVESTIGATION/ CLINICAL PERFORMANCE STUDIES
-
Published experience gained by routine diagnostic testing
-
Prospective or retrospective studies Existing manufacturer data Data
from equivalent devices Data from curated databases/registries/reference
databases Data from outside the EU with justification on applicability
REAL-WORLD PERFORMANCE DATA Data obtained from PMPF/ PMCF
a) MDSW intended to analyse sleep quality data An independent MDSW
intended to take into account accelerometer and microphone data to
determine quality of sleep and to estimate the expected success rate of
CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) treatment for sleep apnoea.
The Manufacturer claims that the MDSW -
determines the quality of sleep that impacts the general well-being.
monitors quality of sleep in patients with sleep disorders such as sleep
apnoea (using phone sensors/wearable devices) estimates the expected
success rate of CPAP therapy.
Valid Clinical Association To establish VALID CLINICAL ASSOCIATION,
review literature. -
Objective quality of sleep is measured by sleep duration, efficiency and
fragmentation. It is further well-established that quality of sleep
impacts general well-being such as concentration, risk-factors for
cardiovascular disease, mood, cognitive abilities, etc.
Page 18 of 21
-
It is not well-established that the success of CPAP therapy can be
predicted by monitoring the quality of sleep. Address the association of
accelerometer and microphone data to established quality of sleep
parameters (e.g. sleep duration, efficiency and fragmentation).
The VALID CLINICAL ASSOCIATION has been not established without gaps for
prediction of success of CPAP therapy, which requires generation of
missing clinical data. Technical Performance -
Confirm with verification and validation tests that the app can reliably
and reproducibly calculate sleep quality scoring. Confirm compatibility
between the MDSW and the device equipped with the sensors to ensure data
can be utilised in the intended way.
Clinical Performance -
In addition to the USABILITY assessment, the manufacturer would perform
a retrospective study on previously obtained data to confirm that
success of CPAP therapy can be predicted based on the quality of sleep.
b) MDSW intended for image segmentation An independent MDSW intended to
allow automatic detection of organs and anatomical structures (such as
the aorta) in CT scans with the accuracy of a radiologist. The
Manufacturer claims that the MDSW: -
detects abdominal aortic aneurisms on abdominal CT scans, detects
compression fractures on vertebrae, detects liver cysts.
Valid Clinical Association To establish VALID CLINICAL ASSOCIATION,
review literature. -
The normal shape and size of anatomy is well established. Segmentation
techniques on cross-sectional images correlates well with the actual
size and shape.
The VALID CLINICAL ASSOCIATION has been established without gaps
identified. Technical Performance -
Confirm with verification and validation tests the basic technical
performance such as display, modification, window levelling of images,
measurements including confirmation of accuracy, sensitivity and
reliability of the MDSW as per the expected performance.
Page 19 of 21
Clinical Performance -
USABILITY assessment including the intended user groups in conjunction
with the VALID CLINICAL ASSOCIATION and validation of TECHNICAL
PERFORMANCE results has been determined as
-
sufficient to demonstrate conformity with relevant GSPRs. In cases where
data is available, a retrospective analysis can be performed. In cases
where data does not represent the variability of input parameters, for
the CLINICAL PERFORMANCE of the segmentation algorithm, the missing data
could be generated in a prospective CLINICAL INVESTIGATION.
c) MDSW intended to detect inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD)
Self-testing independent MDSW intended for the semi-quantitative
detection of calprotectin from a faecal sample. Reagents are added to
the sample resulting in a colour change. The sample is then photographed
on a smartphone, and the image is evaluated by an MDSW application (app)
running on the phone. The MDSW app detects the colour change in the
sample and interprets the concentration of calprotectin. The test is
intended as an aid in monitoring and staging of patients with
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Manufacturer's claims that the MDSW
app -
aids in monitoring and staging the disease level of patients with
inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). aids in differentiation between IBD
and functional bowel disorders. helps patients avoid unnecessary
clinical visits.
Scientific Validity To establish SCIENTIFIC VALIDITY, review literature.
-
The SCIENTIFIC VALIDITY could address how the calprotectin level
corresponds to the IBD level and stages. Furthermore, it should address,
whether calprotectin levels are suitable to differentiate between IBD
and functional bowel disorders. It is well-established that calprotectin
concentration in faecal matter can be reliably measured in test strips
by change of colour. The colour intensity is directly representative of
the concentration of calprotectin.
Analytical Performance -
Confirm the MDSW app can detect reliably and accurately the colour of
the test strip compared to human observation, taking into account
environmental factors.
Clinical Performance -
The manufacturer should assess the initial performance and feasibility
by creating CLINICAL PERFORMANCE metrics, taking into account
sensitivity, specificity and confidence intervals. Any claims regarding
CLINICAL BENEFIT should be supported by sufficient clinical performance
data. USABILITY should be confirmed by the manufacturer.

d) Active devices containing MDSW to enable their intended purpose
Active devices, such as diagnostic or therapeutic devices, that include
MDSW which drives the device in a way that, without the software it
would not be able to fulfil its intended purpose. This software does not
perform a medical purpose on its own. The CLINICAL EVALUATION of the
MDSW should not be performed independently but should be performed
together with the driven device. e) MDSW which provides an additional
user-interface to control an insulin pump A MDSW intended to virtualise
controls of an insulin pump additionally on a smartphone app by
connecting to it. As the software is driving the insulin pump, it is not
performing a medical purpose on its own, nor is it creating information
on its own for medical purposes. The CLINICAL EVALUATION of the MDSW app
should not be performed independently but should be performed together
with the driven insulin pump. f) MDSW intended to analyse exhaled CO2 in
a life-sustaining device in order to control ventilator settings The
MDSW uses physiological data of the patient (e.g. exhaled CO2, blood
oxygen saturation) to control a ventilation device (e.g. frequency,
volume and pressure). The MDSW allows the device to maintain the pre-set
value at a desired target (defined by the clinician) without periodic
user adjustments needed. This MDSW is part of a closed-loop system. The
CLINICAL EVALUATION should not be limited to the MDSW and should include
pre-clinical and clinical investigations, encompassing the entire
closed-loop system.
