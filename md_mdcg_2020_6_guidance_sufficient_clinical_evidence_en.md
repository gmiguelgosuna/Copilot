> **1. Definitions**
>
> **1.1. Terms defined in MDR Article 2**
>
> The following terms are used as defined in the Medical Device
> Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (MDR):
>
>  'performance';^1^
>
>  'risk';^2^
>
>  'intended purpose'^3^
>
>  'benefit-risk determination';^4^\
>  'clinical evaluation';^5^
>
>  'clinical investigation';^6^
>
>  'clinical data';^7^
>
>  'clinical evidence';^8^
>
>  'clinical performance';^9^
>
> It should be noted that clinical performance may arise from either
> 'direct or indirect medical effects' 'leading to a clinical benefit
> for patients'; see comments for relevance to clinical benefit below
>
>  'clinical benefit'.^10^
>
> It should be noted that clinical benefits may be either direct or
> indirect; for example
>
> devices such as guidewires may assist other medical devices in
> achieving their intended purpose, without having a direct therapeutic
> or diagnostic function themselves.
>
>  'generic device group'.^11^
>
> **1.2. Additional terms not defined in MDR Article 2**
>
> Additional terms which are not explicitly defined in Article 2 of the
> MDR, but which are essential to evaluation of benefit-risk and
> clinical evaluation conclusions:
>
> 1 MDR, Article 2(22). 2 MDR, Article 2(23). 3 MDR, Article 2(12). 4
> MDR, Article 2(24). 5 MDR, Article 2(44). 6 MDR, Article 2(45). 7 MDR,
> Article 2(48). 8 MDR, Article 2(51). 9 MDR, Article 2(52). 10 MDR,
> Article 2(53).

>  'legacy devices': this is considered to include all devices
> previously CE marked under the European Medical Devices Directive
> 93/42/EEC (MDD) or Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive
> 90/385/EEC (AIMDD)
>
>  'well-established technology': this terminology is used in Article
> 52(5) and Article 61(8) of the MDR, but is not defined in these
> articles. The term is not restricted to the devices listed in Article
> 61(6b); Article 61(8) explicitly states that this includes devices
> *similar to* the exempted devices listed in Article 61(6b), which
> might be added to that list in future. The common features of the
> devices which are well- established technologies are that they all
> have:
>
> o relatively simple, common and stable designs with little evolution;
>
> o their generic device group has well-known safety and has not been
>
> associated with safety issues in the past;
>
> o well-known clinical performance characteristics and their generic
> device
>
> group are standard of care devices where there is little evolution in
> indications and the state of the art;
>
> o a long history on the market.
>
> Therefore, any devices that meet all these criteria may be considered
> "well-
>
> established technologies".
>
>  'scientific validity', 'scientifically valid': this terminology is
> used in the MDR in
>
> reference to clinical data planning, evaluation and conclusions^12^.
> Clinical evaluations must follow a "defined and methodologically sound
> procedure"^13^, for which expectations of scientific validity are
> implicit. Embedded in the term 'scientific validity' are concepts
> including adequacy of study design and controls for bias,
> appropriateness and relevance of research questions, adequacy of
> sample sizes and statistical analyses, completeness of data, adequacy
> of follow up period, and appropriateness of conclusions on the basis
> of objective evidence. Section 9.3.1 of MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev. 4 provides
> guidance for the evaluation of methodological quality and scientific
> validity under the MDD/AIMDD which are equally valid under the MDR
> which can be considered to apply when referencing 'scientific
> validity' in this guidance.
>
>  'level of clinical evidence': this terminology is used in the MDR
> with respect to requirements for demonstration of conformity with the
> relevant GSPR and overall benefit-risk^14^. It is understood to
> encompass the amount and quality of evidence (i.e. its
> characterisation by quality, quantity, completeness and statistical
> validity, etc.) required to demonstrate safety, performance and the
> benefit-risk conclusion of a medical device. It should not be confused
> with the term 'levels of evidence' (as used in evidence-based
> medicine) which is used to rank study designs, and is only a part of
> the concept 'level of clinical evidence'. Regarding the assessment of
> the level of clinical evidence for the device in question, see
> sections 6.3 and 6.5d of this document.
>
>  'state of the art': IMDRF/GRRP WG/N47 provides the following
> definition: *Developed stage of current technical capability and/or
> accepted clinical practice in*
>
> *regard to products, processes and patient management, based on the
> relevant* *consolidated findings of science, technology and
> experience.*
>
> 12 MDR Annex XV, Chapter I, Article 2(2.1) and (2.6). 13 MDR Article
> 61(3).

> *Note: The state-of-the-art embodies what is currently and generally
> accepted as* *good practice in technology and medicine. The
> state-of-the-art does not* *necessarily imply the most technologically
> advanced solution. The state-of-the-art* *described here is sometimes
> referred to as the "generally acknowledged state-of-* *the-art*
>
>  'intended use': The MDR defines 'intended purpose', but not
> 'intended use'. 'intended use' should be considered to have the same
> meaning as 'intended purpose'.
>
>  'indication', 'indication for use': refers to the clinical condition
> that is to be diagnosed, prevented, monitored, treated, alleviated,
> compensated for, replaced, modified or controlled by the medical
> device. It should be distinguished from 'intended purpose/intended
> use', which describes the effect of a device. All devices have an
> intended purpose/intended use, but not all devices have an indication
> (e.g. medical devices with an intended purpose of disinfection or
> sterilisation of devices).
>
>  'similar device': devices belonging to the same generic device
> group. The MDR defines this as a set of devices having the same or
> similar intended purposes or a commonality of technology allowing them
> to be classified in a generic manner not reflecting specific
> characteristics^15^.

> **4. Introduction and context**
>
> This section is intended to provide an introduction and context, and
> not to modify the interpretation of the MDR.
>
> MDR Article 61(1) states:
>
> *Confirmation of conformity with relevant general safety and
> performance* *requirements set out in Annex I under the normal
> conditions of the intended use of* *the device, and the evaluation of
> the undesirable side-effects and of the* *acceptability of the
> benefit-risk ratio referred to in Sections 1 and 8 of Annex I, shall*
> *be based on clinical data providing sufficient clinical evidence,
> including where* *applicable relevant data as referred to in Annex
> III.*
>
> *The manufacturer shall specify and justify the level of clinical
> evidence necessary* *to demonstrate conformity with the relevant
> general safety and performance* *requirements. That level of clinical
> evidence shall be appropriate in view of the* *characteristics of the
> device and its intended purpose.*
>
> *To that end, manufacturers shall plan, conduct and document a
> clinical evaluation* *in accordance with this Article and Part A of
> Annex XIV.*
>
> MDR Article 61(4) states that clinical investigations shall be
> performed for Class III and implantable devices, but distinct
> exemptions from this requirement are identified both in this article
> and in Articles 61(5) and 61(6). The common theme of these exempted
> devices is that they have been previously marketed (Article 61(6)) or
> have been demonstrated to be equivalent to devices previously marketed
> (Article 61(5)).
>
> Article 61(6a and b) further distinguishes between legacy devices
> (Article 61(6a)) which have been previously marketed under 93/42/EEC
> or 90/385/EEC and a specific subset of well-established technologies
> (WET) (Article 61(6b)).
>
> The following should be noted:
>
>  all such exemptions from clinical investigations require that the
> clinical evaluation
>
> is based on "sufficient clinical data";
>
>  the basic clinical evaluation requirements for the legacy devices
> described in
>
> Article 61(6a) and the devices of Article 61(6b) are the same:
> "sufficient clinical data" and compliance to common specifications
> where these exist. The distinction between the two is that the devices
> listed in Article 61(6b) are not explicitly required to have had prior
> certification under the Directives to be exempted from the requirement
> for clinical investigations that otherwise apply to Class III and
> implantable devices;
>
>  both the Directives and the MDR require the quantity and quality of
> clinical data to be sufficient to demonstrate safety, performance and
> the acceptability of the benefit-risk ratio: both the Directives and
> the MDR require clinical evidence to be sound and the conclusions
> derived from this evidence to be scientifically valid.
>
> Article 61(10)^16^ allows for the use of non-clinical data for
> demonstration of conformity with GSPRs:
>
> *Without prejudice to paragraph 4,where the demonstration of

> and on consideration of the* *specifics of the interaction between the
> device and the human body, the clinical* *performance intended and the
> claims of the manufacturer.*
>
> Article 61(10) cannot be applied to Class III or implantable devices.
> In exceptional cases Article 61(10) may be applied for all other

> **5. General aspects**
>
> "Sufficient clinical evidence" is not defined in the MDR. The
> definition of "clinical evidence" itself contains the word
> "sufficient" but it is related to the amount and quality of the
> clinical data and the clinical evaluation results which "allow a
> qualified assessment of whether the device is safe and achieves the
> intended clinical benefits when used as intended by the
> manufacturer".^17^ Sufficient clinical evidence is also mentioned in
> the MDR Article 61 where it is provided that the confirmation of
> conformity with the relevant GSPR shall be based on sufficient
> clinical evidence. Therefore, "sufficient clinical evidence" is
> understood as "the present result of the qualified assessment which
> has reached the conclusion that the device is safe and achieves the
> intended benefits". It is important to note that clinical evaluation
> is a process where this qualified assessment has to be done on a
> continuous basis.
>
> Compared to Directives 93/42/EEC and 90/385/EEC, MDR provides greater
> detail and additional requirements with respect to the process of
> clinical evaluation, for the purpose of confirmation of conformity
> with relevant GSPR. The generation of clinical data and their
> evaluation providing sufficient clinical evidence is part of a
> lifecycle approach to medical devices.
>
> The MDR reinforces a number of important factors which are relevant to
> clinical evaluation. This includes:
>
>  **Consideration of available alternative treatment options** is
> required for the
>
> confirmation of the acceptability of the benefit-risk ratio.^18^
>
>  **The acceptability of the benefit-risk ratio** must be based upon
> clinical data
>
> providing sufficient clinical evidence including where applicable
> relevant data from post-market surveillance.^19^
>
>  **The term "clinical evidence" is introduced and the level of
> clinical evidence** must be specified and justified by the
> manufacturer, taking the characteristics of the device and the
> intended purpose into account.^20^
>
>  **The incorporation of post market surveillance (PMS) data** in
> particular the post-market clinical follow-up (PMCF) data into the
> process of clinical evaluation.^21^ Manufacturers are required to
> establish a post-market surveillance plan in accordance with Annex III
> of the MDR and the clinical data arising from this PMS shall be
> incorporated into the clinical evaluation.
>
>  **The definition of equivalence** is now included in the text of the
> MDR,^22^ and the
>
> process to demonstrate equivalence is defined^23^.

>
> When it comes to the first MDR conformity assessment of a legacy
> device the pre-market
>
> and post-market clinical data generated for the purpose of MDD/AIMDD

> conformity assessment under the Directives is clinical data providing
> sufficient clinical evidence for the purpose of MDR requirements.
> Legacy devices which have been placed on the market have been
> subjected to conformity assessment and therefore are presumed to have
> been supported by clinical data^25^. Post- market clinical data
> together with the clinical data generated for the conformity
> assessment under the MDD/AIMDD will be the basis of the clinical
> evaluation process for legacy devices under the MDR.
>
> During the period of validity of the MDD/AIMDD certificates, the MDR

> **6.2.2. Post-market sources of clinical data**

> Post-market sources of clinical data refer to data collected following

>  Device registries;

>  Data retrieved from the literature.

> a\. Clinical benefits
>
> Clinical benefit means *"the positive impact of a device on the health
> of an individual,* *expressed in terms of a meaningful, measurable,
> patient-relevant clinical outcome(s),* *including outcome(s) related
> to diagnosis, or a positive impact on patient management or* *public
> health".*^42^ The type of clinical benefit associated with a device
> depends upon the device under evaluation and its intended purpose.
> Examples of clinical benefits and their quantification can be found in
> Appendix A7.2 letters (b) and (c) of MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev. 4. It should be
> noted that while direct clinical benefits should be supported by
> clinical data, indirect clinical benefits may be demonstrable by other
> evidence such as:
>
>  pre-clinical and bench test data (eg compliance to product standards
> or common
>
> specifications);
>
>  real world data such as registries, information deriving from
> insurance database
>
> records, etc;
>
>  data from another device that is used with the subject device which
> does have
>
> direct clinical data (eg, data from a stent used to justify safety and
> performance of a guidewire).
>
> A determination of the level of clinical evidence required to
> demonstrate an indirect clinical benefit should be made on the basis
> of a thorough risk assessment and evaluation of short, medium and long
> term clinical risks (for example, a guidewire, although used
> transiently, may have long term clinical risks if it leads to vessel
> dissection).
>
> b\. Risks
>
> Risk means the combination of the probability of occurrence of harm
> and the severity of that harm.^43^ The MDR requires manufacturers to
> establish, document, implement and maintain a system for risk
> management.^44^ The standard ISO 14971^45^ provides such a process for

> lifecycle approach. The Annex I of the MDR require that manufacturers
> reduce risks as far as possible, and to do this, manufacturers must

> the intended use and during reasonably foreseeable misuse.^46^
>
> The determination as to which risks require the generation of clinical
> data to support either the probability and severity of a particular

> c\. Benefit-risk determination, state of the art, alternative
> treatment options
>
> The MDR requires that any risks which may be associated with the use
> of the device are *"compatible with a high level of protection of
> health and safety, taking into account the* *generally acknowledged
> state of the art"*^48^ and that the determination of the acceptability
> of the benefit-risk ratio is "*based on the state of the art in
> medicine*".^49^
>
> It is important to remember that a medical device may be used for an
> indication for which there are many alternative medical options. This
> may include the use of medicinal products, other medical devices,
> other medical or allied health professional interventions, a
> combination of any of these or no intervention. As such, in order to
> determine a benefit- risk ratio, up-to-date alternatives must be
> considered for legacy devices. The appropriateness and relevance of an
> alternative treatment option depends upon a wide range of factors,
> including the nature of the healthcare system and patient preferences.
> To help to describe alternatives, it is necessary to describe the
> 'state of the art' for the treatment of the indicated clinical
> condition taking alternative treatments into account. The state of the
> art in this context can be taken to mean the generally accepted most
> effective treatment option, for the intended purpose relevant to the
> device under consideration. Occasionally, this may be subject to
> differences of opinion between clinical evaluators as to what is the
> state of the art, and where such differences exist, these should be
> described and taken into account insofar as is possible. In such
> cases, a thorough evaluation of the results from published clinical
> studies of high methodological quality shall be taken into account.
> Moreover, where applicable, particular attention shall be paid to
> therapy guidelines grounded on principles of evidence based medicine.
> Novel and innovative device technology may be subject to a rapidly
> evolving state of the art for a particular indication, and where this
> exists, it should also be noted.

> Aspects that influence the acceptability of benefits and risks can be

> Manufacturers should conduct a gap analysis with respect to the MDR
