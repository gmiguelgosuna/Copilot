>
> The Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices (1) requires that the
> manufacturer shall draw up a summary of safety and clinical
> performance (SSCP) for implantable devices and for class III devices,
> other than custom-made or investigational devices. The SSCP shall be
> validated by a notified body (NB) and made available to the public via
> the European database on medical devices (Eudamed)^1^.
>
> The SSCP is intended to provide public access to an updated summary of
> clinical data^2^ and other information about the safety and clinical
> performance of the medical device. The SSCP will be an important
> source of information for intended users -- both healthcare
> professionals and if relevant for patients. It is one of several means
> intended to fulfil the objectives of the Medical Device Regulation
> (MDR) to enhance transparency and provide adequate access to
> information^3^.
>
> The SSCP is not intended to:
>
> • give general advice on the diagnosis or treatment of particular
> medical
>
> conditions, nor
>
> • replace the instructions for use (IFU) as the main document that
> will be
>
> provided to ensure the safe use of a particular device, nor
>
> • replace the mandatory information on implant cards^4^ or in any
> other
>
> mandatory documents.
>
> The main purpose of this document is to provide guidance on the
> presentation, content and validation of the SSCP. The word "shall" is
> used when there is a corresponding "shall" in the MDR, otherwise
> "should" or "recommended" etc. is used indicating the interpretation
> of the MDR.

> **General requirements and recommendations for the SSCP**
>
> The information in the SSCP should be sourced entirely from the
> technical documentation (TD) of the device^15^. Examples of such
> documents are design verification/validation reports, the risk
> management report/file, the clinical evaluation report, and
> post-market surveillance (PMS) and post-market clinical follow-up
> (PMCF) plans and reports. The IFU includes information extracted from
> the same sources as the SSCP, but may itself be used as a source for
> the SSCP if appropriate.
>
> The manufacturer will assign to the SSCP an identifier (reference
> number) that within the manufacturer's management system is unique to
> that SSCP and will remain the same for the entire lifetime of the
> SSCP. In combination with the manufacturer's SRN this will allow for
> the unique identification of the SSCP in EUDAMED and in EU.
>
> The SSCP shall be kept updated in Eudamed^16^. When the PMCF
> evaluation report^17^ and the periodic safety update report (PSUR)^18^
> are updated at least annually^19^, the SSCP shall be reviewed and
> updated^20^ if needed to ensure that any clinical and/or safety
> information in the SSCP remains correct and complete. When updating
> the SSCP, all sections of the document shall be updated if needed so
> that they are in alignment with the most current version of the
> relevant parts of the TD of the device.
>
> This guide outlines the minimum content of the SSCP. The manufacturer
> may add further information from the TD of the device to enhance the
> comprehension of the mandatory information providing:

> For further guidance on the contents of the SSCP, please refer to

> been revised to enhance its presentation.
>
> The IFU shall contain all that is needed to directly find the SSCP in
> Eudamed. The following applies to the IFU^23^.
>
> • It shall state that the SSCP is available in the European database
> on medical
>
> devices (Eudamed), where it is linked to the Basic UDI-DI. • It should
> provide the URL to the Eudamed public website:
>
> [[https://ec.europa.eu/tools/eudamed]{.underline}](https://ec.europa.eu/tools/eudamed)
>
> • It should state the value of the Basic UDI-DI. Alternatively,
> another metadata
>
> can be stated provided it can be used to unambiguously search and find
> the intended SSCP in Eudamed.
>
> **Translations to other EU languages**
>
> No single language will be understood by all intended users and
> patients in the EU -- see the European Survey on Language Competences
> initiated by the European Commission (4). In order to meet the
> requirement in the MDR that the SSCP shall be written in a way that is
> clear to the intended user and, if relevant, to the patient^24^, the
> SSCP should be translated into the languages accepted in the Member
> States where the device is envisaged to be sold. This is by analogy
> with the requirement for an IFU^25^. Note that Member States may have
> different language requirements for an IFU depending on whether the
> information is intended for health care professionals or for patients.
> The SSCP part intended for patients should be provided in all the
> languages required for IFUs intended for patients in the Member States
> concerned.
>
> If the selection of European languages for the SSCP does not include
> English, then an English translation of the document should also be
> provided. English is the most common language used in medical
> scientific publications and is understood by many healthcare
> professionals in the EU. Always providing an English-language version
> of the SSCP further enhances access to information^26^ about devices
> available on the EU market.
>
> There should be one SSCP document for each language. Each SSCP
> document should state in which language the SSCP was validated by the
> NB. The manufacturer should ensure, through their quality management
> system, that the

> **Relevant SSCP information for patients**
>
> The MDR indicates that patients are also intended recipients of the
> information in the SSCP, "if relevant"^27^. Devices for which
> information will be especially relevant for patients include:
>
> • implantable devices for which patients will be given implant
> cards^28^, and\
> • class III devices that are intended to be used directly by patients.
>
> For these devices, a part of the SSCP specifically intended for
> patients should be provided.
>
> Note: Devices listed in MDR Annex XVI, and eligible for a SSCP, should
> always be considered as relevant for patient information.
>
> For devices other than the two groups listed above, including any
> devices listed in Annex XVI and eligible for a SSCP, the manufacturer
> may consider whether it is relevant to provide specific information
> intended for patients. This can be based on the manufacturer's
> analysis of the device in question.
>
> **Readability**
>
> The SSCP should always have one part for intended users/healthcare
> professionals, and when it is relevant (see above) a second part for
> patients. Both should be clear and provide information at an
> appropriate depth to reflect the healthcare professionals' and the
> patients' different levels of knowledge^29^.
>
> For further guidance, see references (5) and (6) in this guide. It
> should not be assumed that the patient has any formal education in a
> medical discipline or any prior knowledge of medical terminology or
> clinical research. It is recommended that the readability of the part
> of the SSCP intended for patients is assessed for example by a test
> given to lay persons. The manufacturer may use a method it finds
> adequate for the readability test to confirm that the SSCP is written
> in a way that is clear to the patient^30^.
>
> Medical terminology, relevant for the medical device and the clinical
> context, should be used consistently throughout the part of the SSCP
> that is intended for healthcare professionals.
>
> **Stylistic recommendations**
>
> The SSCP should be presented in an organised and unambiguous manner.
>
> Usually, abbreviations and acronyms should not be used; if they are,
> then in the text, the abbreviation or acronym should follow the full
> phrase it is intended to replace. It may then be used thereafter
> throughout the document.

> Medical terms should be explained in simple language in the parts
> intended for patients. Consistency should be assured by giving the lay
> term with a description first, and then the medical term immediately
> afterwards (in brackets). On a case-by- case basis the lay or medical
> term (but preferably the lay term) may then be used throughout the
> part intended for patients.
>
> It is recommended to keep the information for patients/lay persons and
> for intended users/healthcare professionals in two separate parts of
> the SSCP, separated by a "page break". This enhances their readability
> and facilitates printing of each part separately. See the template in
> the Appendix of this document.
>
> The SSCP should be written in a font type and size which allow easy
> reading. Since the SSCP is intended for the public, it needs to be in
> a format that everyone can read (and that is not editable) without the
> need for a license. Therefore the SSCP file uploaded in Eudamed should
> be in PDF format. When downloaded, the PDF file should be printable
> and searchable with the search function in the program used to view
> the file, for example the Adobe Reader.

> **Validation and uploading of the SSCP**
>
> **Validation of the initial SSCP by the NB**
>
> When the NB has assessed that all the required elements^31^ are
> included in the draft SSCP, accurately presented and in alignment with
> the most current version of relevant documents in the TD, the SSCP has
> been *validated* by the NB.
>
> In the circumstance that the conformity assessment is performed
> according to Annex X and XI in the MDR and there are two NBs involved,
> it is the NB which assesses the TD according to Annex X that shall
> validate the SSCP.
>
> The validation of the SSCP by the NB covers only one of the
> language(s) accepted by the NB and agreed with the manufacturer. The
> manufacturer should state in the revision history in each SSCP
> document in which language the SSCP was validated by the NB.
>
> The timing of the SSCP validation may depend on the class of device
> and the conformity assessment routes:
>
> • For class III devices and class IIb implantable devices, except
> sutures and staples etc.^32^, the validation is performed when a draft
> SSCP as a part of the application documents is submitted to the NB
> involved in the conformity assessment^33^, prior to issuing the
> certificate.
>
> • For class IIa implantable and some IIb implantable devices such as
> sutures and staples etc^34^, a draft SSCP as a part of the application
> documents shall be submitted to the NB involved in the conformity
> assessment. The draft SSCP shall be validated by the NB^35^.

>
> **Uploading of the SSCP in Eudamed**
>
> The SSCP shall be uploaded in Eudamed by the NB^44^, which is the only

>
> The manufacturer should state in a revision history in the SSCP

>
> • The NB shall upload a SSCP whenever it has been validated against

>
> **Description of residual risks and undesirable effects**
>
> Risk is defined in the MDR^56^ as the combination of the probability
> of occurrence of harm and the severity of that harm. Harm is defined
> in the standard ISO 14971:2012^57^ as physical injury or damage to the
> health of people, or damage to property or the environment. Thus the
> term 'risk' includes both clinical and non-clinical harms.
>
> The term 'residual risk' is defined in the standard ISO 14971:2012^58^
> as "risk remaining after risk control measures have been taken".
>
> There is a requirement in the MDR that the IFU shall contain
> information on any residual risks and any undesirable
> side-effects^59^, *i.e.* no sort of residual risk or undesirable
> side-effect related to the device is excluded from disclosure. The
> SSCP should contain information on at least the same residual risks
> and undesirable side-effects as included in the IFU.
>
> For the purpose of the SSCP, an undesirable effect^60^ can be
> understood as any undesirable side-effect related to the device and
> that is experienced by the patient and/or can be diagnosed and/or
> measured in the patient.
>
> For the clarity of the SSCP, undesirable side-effects can be annotated
> also in other terms as appropriate, to present any undesirable
> side-effects related to the device in question. There may be
> device-specific terminology for describing side-effects and risks in
> device-specific ISO standards or scientific literature that is
> important to use to allow comparison of clinical data.
>
> For example, some events indicated in the MDR by the terms 'adverse
> events'^61^, 'undesirable side-effects' or 'incidents'^62^, may all be
> annotated as 'adverse events' in the scientific literature.
>
> Any further discussion on risks can be included in the SSCP if needed
> for clarity or comprehension.
>
> **Quantitative data**

> The definition of risk^63^ includes the probability of occurrence of
