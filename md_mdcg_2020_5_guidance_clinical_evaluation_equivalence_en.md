> The Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices^1^, hereafter referred
> to as the MDR (medical device regulation), provides a possibility to
> use clinical data related to an equivalent device in the clinical
> evaluation required for a device under conformity assessment^2^.
>
> Whilst carrying out a clinical investigation is the most direct way to
> generate clinical data concerning the safety and performance of
> medical devices for the purpose of CE marking, clinical data can also
> be sourced from*^3^*
>
>  *clinical investigation(s) or other studies reported in scientific
> literature, of a*
>
> *device for which equivalence to the device in question can be
> demonstrated,*
>
>  *reports published in peer reviewed scientific literature on other
> clinical*
>
> *experience of either the device in question or a device for which
> equivalence to* *the device in question can be demonstrated*
>
> Equivalence shall be demonstrated according to the MDR
> requirements^4^.
>
> The European Commission has published a guide on clinical evaluation
> under the directives 93/42/EEC and 90/385/EEC; MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev. 4^5^.
> This MEDDEV guide should be used also during the process of
> demonstrating equivalence under the MDR. However, it has been
> recognised that some of the requirements set out in MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev.
> 4 are not fully aligned with the MDR and that further guidance to
> address the differences would be of benefit to industry and other
> stakeholders. Only the text of the MDR is legally binding. In cases of
> divergence between the MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev. 4, this MDCG guidance and the
> MDR, the MDR shall take precedence.
>
> This MDCG guidance does not introduce any new requirements.
>
> The demonstration of equivalence does not remove the requirement to
> always conduct a clinical evaluation in accordance with the MDR. It is
> the demonstration of equivalence^6^ that allows the manufacturer to
> let clinical data from an equivalent device enter the clinical
> evaluation process of the device in question for the purpose of
> confirmation of conformity with relevant general safety and

> 2\. Scope
>
> This MDCG guidance covers the demonstration of equivalence, based on
> data
>
> pertaining to an already existing device on the market^9^, for the
> purpose of CE-marking under the MDR.
>
> One of the purposes of this document is to highlight the differences
> between the MDR and the MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev.4 specifically with regards
> to equivalence. It is also intended to provide additional guidance and
> support a harmonised approach to the demonstration of equivalence
> across the EU.
>
> In addition, non-exhaustive guidance and references have been provided
> with respect to device considerations for medical devices
> incorporating an ancillary medicinal product.
>
> This MDCG guidance also covers products without an intended medical
> purpose listed in Annex XVI of the MDR.
>
> 3\. Equivalence
>
> The MDR requires^10^ that technical, biological and clinical
> characteristics are
>
> considered when demonstrating equivalence to another device. Whilst
> these general characteristics are described in the MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev. 4
> Appendix 1 and are aligned with the MDR requirement, there are
> differences in the criteria that are set out for each of the three
> characteristics. Differences in criteria between the MDR and the
> MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev. 4 are highlighted below and are accompanied by some
> explanatory text.

> be the same, not only similar. The corresponding wording from MEDDEV
> 2.7/1 rev. 4 is presented for information above. Consideration must be
> given to the characteristics mentioned above and a gap analysis should
> be conducted by the manufacturer to evaluate any clinically
> significant difference(s).
>
> Modifications^30^ of a device may be implemented for a variety of
> reasons. If the differences have been introduced to address specific
> safety and/or performance issues it shall be duly justified, that
> there would be no clinically significant difference in the safety and
> clinical performance other than the intended improvements related to

> \(b\) Manufacturers may identify more than one equivalent device to

>
> This means that manufacturers shall not use different parts of

> The MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev. 4 is in line with this approach.

> In exceptional cases, a deviation from this principle may be

> investigated and documented both on the level of potential
> interference between the devices in the system, as well as on the
> overall safety and clinical performance of the device system.
>
> \(c\) Regarding the clinical evaluation, the MDR requires^33^ that the
> manufacturer shall specify and justify the level of clinical evidence
> necessary to demonstrate conformity with the relevant general safety
> and performance requirements. That level of clinical evidence shall be
> appropriate in view of the characteristics of the device and its
> intended purpose^34^. In addition, considerations of equivalence
> **shall be based on proper scientific justification**^35^.
>
> This implies that technical, biological and clinical characteristics
> shall be duly investigated and documented. The manufacturer is
> expected to fully identify and disclose any differences between the

> A manufacturer of **implantable devices and class III devices** shall

> For a manufacturer of **implantable devices and class III devices**
> claiming equivalence to an already marketed device **not manufactured
> by him**, in addition to the requirements in MDR Article 61(4), the
> manufacturer must have a contract in place that allows full access to
> the technical documentation on an ongoing basis^40^. Furthermore, the
> MDR also requires that the original clinical evaluation of the
> equivalent device has been performed in compliance with the
> requirements of the MDR. This implies that the presumed equivalent
> device is certified under the MDR. As such, it will not be possible to
> claim equivalence to a device certified with respect to the Directives
> 93/42/EEC or 90/385/EEC.
>
> \(e\) For **devices other than implantable devices and class III
> devices** and where the manufacturer wants to claim equivalence, MDR
> Article 61 (3) is applicable. This requirement does not specify
> whether the device is presumed to be marketed within the EU.
> Therefore, it will be possible to claim equivalence to a device
> certified with respect to the Directives 93/42/EEC or 90/385/EEC or
> the MDR.
>
> However, exceptions can be considered, and equivalence claimed to a
> device that is not CE-marked, provided all relevant MDR requirements
> regarding equivalence and clinical evaluation can be met. This
> includes
>
>  that the manufacturer shall have sufficient levels of access to the
> data relating to devices with which they are claiming equivalence^41^

> The term 'similar devices' may be understood as devices belonging to

> generic device group. The MDR defines this^49^ as a set of devices
> having the same or similar intended purposes or a commonality of
> technology allowing them to be classified in a generic manner not
> reflecting specific characteristics.
>
> In cases where equivalence cannot be demonstrated under the MDR, the
> data from similar devices may be useful for a variety of other
> purposes, for example:
>
> 1\. Ensuring that the risk management system is comprehensive by
> identifying
>
> relevant hazards and clinical risks.
>
> 2\. Understanding the state of the art, the natural course of disease
> and
>
> alternative available treatment options.
>
> 3\. Helping to define the scope of the clinical evaluation, by
> identifying any design
>
> features in similar devices that pose special performance or safety
> concerns. 4. Provide input for clinical investigation design or
> post-market clinical follow-up
>
> design, and the post-market surveillance system.
>
> 5\. Identification of relevant and specified clinical outcome
> parameters for the
>
> intended clinical benefits, based on the published clinical data
> pertaining to the similar device(s).
>
> 6\. To define minimum requirements for a quantified clinical benefit
> that is considered clinically relevant, and/or to identify acceptable
> occurrence rates of
>
> risks and adverse events.

> MDR^51^, the data shall then progress to data appraisal and analysis
> in order to evaluate whether the clinical data are providing

> conformity with the relevant general safety and performance
> requirements (GSPR)^52^.
>
> For identifying, appraising and analysing available clinical data from

> manufacturers will find facilitative guidance in sections 8-10 of
> MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev. 4.

> In the event that the data do not meet the MDR definition of clinical

> Scientific justifications shall be provided for the different
