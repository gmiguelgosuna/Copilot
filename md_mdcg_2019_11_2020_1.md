>
> This document, which primarily targets medical software manufacturers,
> defines the criteria for the qualification of software falling within
> the scope of the new medical devices regulations^1^ and provides
> guidance on the application of classification criteria for software
> under Regulation (EU) 2017/745 -- MDR and Regulation (EU) 2017/746 --
> IVDR.^2^ The guidance also provides information related to placing on

> 3\. Qualification
>
> 3.1. Introduction to qualification criteria
>
> The purpose of this section is to clarify what software is in itself
> subject to the medical devices regulations.
>
> Software must have a medical purpose on its own to be qualified as a
> medical device software (MDSW). It should be noted that the intended
> purpose as described by the manufacturer of the software is relevant
> for the qualification and classification of any device.
>
> In order to be qualified as medical device software, the product must
> first fulfil the definition of software according to this guidance and
> the definition of a medical device according to Article 2(1) of
> Regulation (EU) 2017/745 -- MDR. To be qualified as an *in vitro*
> diagnostic medical device software, the product must additionally
> fulfil the definition of an *in vitro* diagnostic medical device
> according to Article 2(2) of Regulation (EU) 2017/746 -- IVDR.
>
> Where a given product does not fall under the definition of a medical
> device, or is excluded by the scope of the Medical Devices
> Regulations, other Community and/or national legislation may be
> applicable. Software that does not meet the definition of a medical
> device or an *in vitro* diagnostic medical device (i.e. software that
> is not MDSW) but is intended by the manufacturer to be an accessory
> for a medical device, or an *in vitro* diagnostic medical device,
> falls respectively under the scope of the Regulation (EU) 2017/745 --
> MDR or Regulation (EU) 2017/746 -- IVDR.
>
> Software can directly control a (hardware) medical device (e.g.
> radiotherapy treatment software), can provide immediate
> decision-triggering information (e.g. blood glucose meter software),
> or can provide support for healthcare professionals (e.g. ECG
> interpretation software).
>
> It is important to clarify that not all software used within
> healthcare is qualified as a medical device. For example, "Simple
> search", which refers to the retrieval of records by matching record
> metadata against record search criteria or to the retrieval of
> information does not qualify as medical device software (e.g. library
> functions).
>
> However, software which is intended to process, analyse, create or
> modify medical information may be qualified as a medical device
> software if the creation or modification of that information is
> governed by a medical intended purpose. For example, the software
> which alters the representation of data for a medical purpose would
> qualify as a medical device software. (e.g. "searching image for
> findings that support a clinical hypothesis as to the diagnosis or
> evolution of therapy" or "software which locally amplifies the
> contrast of the finding on an image display so that it serves as a
> decision support or suggests an action to be taken by the user").
> However, altering the representation of data for
> embellishment/cosmetic or compatibility purposes does not readily
> qualify the software as medical device software.
>
> Software intended for non-medical purposes (excluding MDR Annex XVI
> devices), such as invoicing or staff planning, does not qualify as a
> medical device software. These software do not fall under the Medical
> Devices Regulations.

>
> A task such as e-mailing, web or voice messaging, data parsing, word
> processing, and back-up is by itself not considered as having a
> medical purpose.
>
> Additionally, software may run on different operating systems or in
> virtual environments. These operating systems or virtual environments
> do not impact the qualification criteria.
>
> It must be highlighted that the risk of harm to patients, users of the
> software, or any other person, related to the use of the software
> within healthcare, including a possible malfunction is not a criterion
> on whether the software qualifies as a medical device.
>
> 3.2. **Medical Device Software (MDSW)**
>
> Medical device software is software that is intended to be used,
> **alone** or in **combination**, for a purpose as specified in the
> definition of a "medical device" in the MDR or IVDR, regardless of
> whether the software is independent or driving or influencing the use
> of a device.
>
> **Note 1:** MDSW may be independent**,** by having its own intended
> medical purpose and thus meeting the definition of a medical device or
> *in vitro* diagnostic medical device on its own (i.e. alone*)*
>
> *MDSW that uses maternal parameters such as age, concentration of
> serum markers and information* *obtained through foetal ultrasound
> examination for evaluating the risk of trisomy 21.*
>
> *MDSW that receives measurements from transrectal ultrasound findings,
> age, and in vitro diagnostic* *instruments and calculates a patient's
> risk of developing prostate cancer.*
>
> *Mass Spectrometry MDSW intended to analyse LC-MS/MS data to be used
> for microorganism* *identification and detection of antibiotic
> resistance.*
>
> *MDSW smartwatch app, which is intended to send alarm notifications to
> the user and/or health* *practitioner when it recognises irregular
> heartbeats for the purpose of detecting cardiac arrhythmia.*
>
> **Note 2:** If the software drives or influences a (hardware) medical
> device and also has a medical purpose, then it is qualified as a MDSW
>
> *Melanoma image analysis software intended to drive a near-infrared
> laser light scanner.*
>
> *MDSW intended to measure and transmit blood glucose levels, calculate
> insulin dose required and* *drive the insulin pump to administer the
> calculated dosage (closed loop insulin delivery system).*
>
> **Note 3:** Software may be qualified as MDSW regardless of its
> location (e.g. operating in the cloud, on a computer, on a mobile
> phone, or as an additional functionality on a hardware medical
> device).
>
> *MDSW that is intended to operate a point of care test from a remote
> location.*
>
> **Note 4:** MDSW may be intended to be used by healthcare
> professionals or laypersons (e.g. patients or other users).^17,\ 18^
>
> *MDSW that provides insulin dose recommendations to a patient
> regardless of the method of delivery* *of the prescribed dose, whether
> via an insulin pump, insulin pen or insulin syringe.*
>

>
> **Decision step 1**: if the product is software according to Section 2
> (Definitions and Abbreviations) of this guidance, then it may be a
> medical device software, proceed to decision step 2; if the product is
> not software according to the definition of this guidance, then it is
> not covered by this guidance but may still be covered by the Medical
> Devices Regulations.
>
> **Decision step 2**: if the product is an MDR Annex XVI device, or is
> an accessory for a medical device^19^, or is software driving or
> influencing the use of a medical device, then it must be considered as
> part of that device in its regulatory process or independently if it
> is an accessory. If it is not, proceed to decision step 3.
>
> **Decision step 3**: if the software does perform an action on data,
> or performs an action beyond storage, archival, communication^20^,
> simple search, lossless compression (i.e. using a compression
> procedure that allows the exact reconstruction of the original data)
> then it may be a medical device software (Refer to section 3.1 for
> more guidance on these software functions) proceed to step 4.
>
> **Decision step 4**: is the action for the benefit of individual
> patients?
>
> Examples of software which are not considered as being for the benefit
> of individual patients are those which are intended only to aggregate
> population data, provide generic diagnostic or treatment pathways (not
> directed to individual patients), scientific literature, medical
> atlases, models and templates as well as software intended only for
> epidemiological studies or registers.
>
> **Decision step 5:** Is the software medical device software (MDSW)
> according to the definition of this guidance?
>
> 19 According to Article 2(2) of the Medical Devices Regulation or *In
> Vitro* Diagnostic Medical Devices Regulation.

> 4.1. Implementing Rules
>
> All implementing rules in Annex VIII of Regulation (EU) 2017/745 shall
> be considered.
>
> **Special considerations on Implementing Rule 3.3 and 3.5:**
>
> The first sentence of implementing **rule 3.3** of Annex VIII
> clarifies the regime applicable to software driving or influencing the
> use of a device:
>
> 'Software, which drives or influences the use of a device, shall fall
> within the same class as the device' The second sentence of
> implementing **rule 3.3** of Annex VIII clarifies that the regime
> applicable to Independent MDSW:
>
> 'If software is independent of any other device, it shall be
> classified in its own right'
>
> This rule should also be considered at least as an orientation for
> finding the correct (minimum) classification of software which is
> placed on the market in combination with a (hardware) medical device.
> Therefore, Medical Device Software that both achieves its own intended
> purpose and also drives or influences the use of a (hardware) device
> for a medical purpose is classified on its own, based on the intended
> purpose achieved. In such a case, however, the risk class shall not be
> lower than the risk class of the hardware medical device.
>
> Implementing **rule 3.5** of Annex VIII is relevant for all devices
> and states that
>
> 'If several rules, or if, within the same rule, several sub-rules,
> apply to the same device based on the device's intended purpose, the
> strictest rule and sub-rule resulting in higher classification will
> apply'
>
> *Melanoma image analysis software intended to be used with a
> near-infrared laser light scanner*, which is considered class IIa per
> Rule 10. The software "drives or influences the use of" the near-
> infrared laser light scanner as it is intended to take control of the
> scanner by letting it execute proprietary multi-exposure programs for
> the detection of melanoma. As such, implementing **rule 3.3** applies.
> However, Rule 11 would also apply based on the intended medical
> purpose of the software e.g. cancer diagnosis. The MDSW would be
> classified as class III based on Rule 11 (see section Classification
> Rules) and per implementing **rule 3.5** of Annex VIII.
>
> 4.2. Classification Rules
>
> Rules 9, 10 and 12 mainly categorise the risks related to the exchange
> of energy/substances between the body and diagnostic or therapeutic
> active devices, taking into account the different healthcare
> situations (condition of patients).
>
> MDSW, in the majority of cases, does not (directly) relate to such
> risks. It relates to the consequences of indirect harm from failure to
> provide correct information.
>
> Therefore, in line with Recital 5 of the Medical Device Regulation and
> international guidance from the IMDRF (International Medical Device
> Regulators Forum)^22^, Rule 11 was introduced into the MDR and is
> intended to address the risks related to the information provided by
> an active device, such as MDSW. Rule 11, in particular, describes and
> categorises the significance of the information provided by the active
> device to the healthcare decision (patient management) in combination
> with the healthcare situation (patient condition).
>
> As software is defined as an active device, for the classification of

> 4.2.1. Rule 11 -- Software for decisions with diagnosis or therapeutic

>
> Rule 11 states:

> *Software intended to provide information which is used to take
> decisions with diagnosis or* *therapeutic purposes is classified as
> class IIa, except if such decisions have an impact that* *may cause:*
>
> *death or an irreversible deterioration of a person\'s state of
> health, in which case it is in class* *III; or*
>
> *a serious deterioration of a person\'s state of health or a surgical

>
> *Software intended to monitor physiological processes is classified as

> physiological parameters, where the nature of variations of* *those
> parameters is such that it could result in immediate danger to the
> patient, in which case* *it is classified as class IIb.*
>
> *All other software is classified as class I.*
>
> The text of Rule 11 can be divided into what are essentially three
> sub-rules that are applied depending on the intended use/purpose of
> the MDSW:
>
> 11a: (3 first paragraphs of Rule 11) intended to provide information
> which is used to take decisions with diagnostic or therapeutic
> purposes;
>
> 11b: (Paragraph 4 of Rule 11) intended to monitor physiological
> processes or parameters;
>
> 11c: (Paragraph 5 of Rule 11) all other uses.
>
> **Sub-rule 11a):**
>
> The wording "intended to provide information which is used to take
> decisions with diagnosis or therapeutic purposes" describes, in very
> general terms, the "mode of action" which is characteristic of all
> MDSW. Therefore, this sub-rule is generally applicable to all MDSW
> (excluding those MDSW that have no medical purpose).
>
> Sub-rule 11a), states that MDSW (which is intended to provide

> There are two exceptions from sub-rule 11a) that are mainly intended

> **d) Communication Systems**
>
> The healthcare sector uses communication systems (e.g. email systems,
> mobile telecommunication systems, video communication systems, paging,
> etc.) to transfer electronic information. Different types of messages
> are sent such as prescription, referrals, images, patient records,
> etc.
>
> Most of the communication systems handle types of messages other than
> medical information. This communication system is intended for general
> purposes, and is used for transferring both medical and non-medical
> information.
>
> Communication systems are normally based on software for general
> purposes, and do not fall within the definition of a medical device.
>
> Communication system modules might be used with other modules that
> might be qualified in their own right as medical devices (MDSW).
>
> *A software module generating alarms based on the monitoring and

> d.1.1.) Telesurgery
>
> Telesurgery is intended to conduct a surgical procedure from a remote
> location. Virtual reality technology may be used to support a remote
> surgeon to control a surgical robot performing the surgical procedure.
>
> Telesurgery systems should be qualified as medical devices according
> to Figure 2 of this document. Remote control software used in
> combination with telesurgery robots is a software that drives or
> influences the use of a medical device. Communication modules
> themselves are not medical devices. Other modules that are intended to
> influence the surgery procedure are qualified as medical devices
> (MDSW).
>
> **e) Web systems for monitoring of data**
>
> A web system for the monitoring of clinical data typically interacts
> with a medical device (e.g. implanted devices or homecare devices),
> and uses a transmitter to send the information over the internet, a
> landline telephone or a mobile network.
>
> The information is collected and stored on a web server usually run by
> an external party who is generally the manufacturer of the system. The
> information can be reached by authorized health professionals or the
> patient through an internet connection.
>
> • **Monitoring of performance of medical devices:**
>
> Modules that are intended to monitor the medical performance of
> medical devices fall under
>
> the medical device regulations.
>
> This includes the clinical performance and failures that could affect
> medical performance of the device. One example of such a product is a
> *web system for monitoring of active implants* *such as pacemakers or
> Intra Cardiac Defibrillators (ICDs).*
>
> • **Monitoring of non-medical performance of medical devices**
>
> Modules that are intended to perform administrative monitoring of
> non-medical performance
>
> of medical devices do not necessarily fall under the scope of the
> medical devices regulations.
>
> *Software for the monitoring of medical devices in hospital systems
> for the purpose of* *maintenance and repair.*

> ***f) In vitro* diagnostic medical device software**
>
> f.1.) Laboratory Information Systems (LIS) and Work Area Managers
> (WAM)
>
> Laboratory Information System (LIS) and Work Area Managers (WAM) mean,
> in this context, systems that support the process from patient sample
> to patient result. Typically, they have pre- analytical functions for
> ordering, sorting and distribution of test samples.
>
> The main task is the management and validation of incoming information
> obtained from *in vitro* diagnostic medical device analysers connected
> to the system, such as calibration, quality control, product expiry
> and feedback (e.g. retesting of samples needed) through
> interconnections with various analytical instruments (technical and
> clinical validation).
>
> Finally the post-analytical process allows communication of laboratory
> results, statistics and optional reporting to external databases.
>
> The software normally supports the following functions:
>
> • Ordering of laboratory tests, samples with labels and sorting;
>
> • Technical and clinical validation, connection to analytic
> instruments;
>
> • Laboratory results and reports on paper, fax or electronic records
> that can be directly returned
>
> to e.g. the ordering clinic's patient record;
>
> • Analytical instruments can be interfaced with Hospital Information
> Systems (HIS), Electronic
>
> Patient Record Systems, Infectious control databases, etc.

>
> f.5.) Image Management System (IMS)
>
> An IMS is a software-based system primarily intended to be networked
> with digital pathology systems, e.g., whole slide scanners, scanning
> microscopes, as well as LIS. It does not contain controls for the
> direct operation of the digital pathology systems, and is intended to

> **Figure 1 - Example 1:**
>
> A software module which runs on an *in vitro* diagnostic medical
> device instrument and tracks how the laboratory is performing in
> real-time on key operational metrics such as test volumes, turnaround
> times, pending tests, and quality control. Its intent is to improve a
> laboratory's operations by providing real-time monitoring of
> performance metrics that can drive change management and continuous
> improvement initiatives within the lab. The software is configurable
> so that customers can choose the metrics on which they would like to
> focus.
>
> **Qualification:** Step 1 is concluded with a "yes" as the software is
> a product which uses a set of instructions (or algorithm) to process
> input data and create output data. Step 2 determines that the software
> is not an MDR Annex XVI device, nor is it an accessory for a medical
> device, nor a software driving or influencing the use of a medical
> device. Step 3 is answered "yes" since the software is doing more than
> storage, archival, communication or simple search of information. Step
> 4 is answered "no" as the software does not perform this action for
> the benefit of individual patients. The conclusion\
> is that the software does not fall under the Medical Devices
> Regulations. This is appropriate since the software is intended to be
> a Laboratory Information Systems (LIS), which is not considered a
> medical device.
>
> **Figure 2 - Example 2:**
>
> MDSW intended to generate a risk score in order to trigger care

> to include other parameters, including *in vitro* diagnostic medical
> device results.
>
> **Qualification:** In decision Step 1, the MDSW can be understood to
> meet criteria (a), (f) and (h), it is therefore answered "yes". Step 2

>
> The purpose of this guidance is to provide a framework for the
> determination of the appropriate level of CLINICAL EVIDENCE required
> for MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE (MDSW) to fulfil the requirements set out
> in Regulation (EU) 2017/745 -- Medical Devices Regulation (MDR) and
> Regulation (EU) 2017/746 -- *In* *Vitro* Diagnostic Medical Devices
> Regulation (IVDR).^1^
>
> In order to promote global convergence, this document takes into
> account certain concepts outlined in International Medical Device
> Regulators Forum (IMDRF) guidance documents (such as N41).^2^
>
> 2\. Scope
>
> This guidance should be applied to MDSW. For the purpose of this
> guidance, MDSW is software that is intended to be used, alone or in
> combination, for a purpose as specified in the definition of a
> "medical device" in the medical devices regulation or *in vitro*
> diagnostic medical devices regulation.
>
> It should be noted that software can be associated^3^ with another
> medical device, by driving or influencing its use. The guideline MDCG
> 2019-11 clarifies that software which is driving or influencing is
> covered by the medical devices regulations^4^ either as a
> part/component of a device or as an accessory for a medical device.
>
> Software developers should refer to MDCG 2019-11 for guidance on the
> appropriate qualification and classification of software prior to such
> software being introduced into the market. The same principles of
> CLINICAL EVALUATION (MDR) / PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (IVDR) apply to all
> MDSW. Conceptually, the following models of software can be understood
> (whereas combinations may be possible, refer to Table 1):
>
> a\) Software for which the manufacturer claims a specific medical
> intended purpose. Such software
>
> has a CLINICAL BENEFIT and requires CLINICAL EVIDENCE within its own
> conformity assessment.
>
> b\) Software for which the manufacturer does not claim any medical
> intended purpose. Such software is intended to drive or influence a
> medical device. The CLINICAL EVIDENCE is provided within the context
> of the driven or influenced device and is therefore out of the scope
> of this document.
>
> It should be recognised that the concept of a CLINICAL BENEFIT for
> MDSW may deviate from that which applies in the case of
> pharmaceuticals or other medical devices, since the benefit of MDSW
> may lie in providing accurate medical information on patients, where
> appropriate, assessed against medical information obtained through the
> use of other diagnostic options and technologies, whereas the final
> clinical outcome for the patient is dependent on further diagnostic
> and/or therapeutic options which could be available.
>
> 1 Depending on the device in question, the level of Clinical Evidence
> may differ and shall be assessed on a case by case basis.

> CLINICAL EVALUATION (MDR) / PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (IVDR) is an
> ongoing process, conducted throughout the life cycle of a MDSW. It is
> a structured, transparent, iterative and continuous process which is
> part of the quality management system for a device. Software that
> qualifies as a MD or an IVD is subject to the same general CLINICAL
> EVALUATION (MDR) / PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (IVDR) principles, laid down
> in the applicable guidelines and regulatory documents, as other MDs/
> IVDs, such as:

-   Establishing and maintaining a CLINICAL EVALUATION (MDR) /
    > PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (IVDR) plan and criteria applied to
    > generate the necessary CLINICAL EVIDENCE based on the
    > characteristics of the device;

-   Identification of the relevant data pertaining to performance and/
    > or safety of the device and any

> remaining unaddressed issues or gaps in the data;

-   Appraisal of the relevant data in terms of quality and its
    > contribution to the CLINICAL EVALUATION

> (MDR) / PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (IVDR);

-   Analysis of the available data and its relevance with regard to
    > demonstrating conformity with the

> relevant General Safety and Performance Requirements (GSPRs);

-   Documenting the relevant data, their assessment and the CLINICAL
    > EVIDENCE derived therefrom, in

> the CLINICAL EVALUATION (MDR) / PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (IVDR) report;

-   Updating the CLINICAL EVALUATION (MDR) / PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
    > (IVDR) and its

> documentation throughout the life cycle of the MDSW concerned with
> data obtained from implementation of the manufacturer\'s Post Market
> Clinical Follow-up / Post Market Performance Follow-up (PMCF /PMPF)

> While the definition of CLINICAL EVALUATION in the MDR and PERFORMANCE
> EVALUATION in the IVDR are not identical (see section 0), there is a
> shared expectation for providing sufficient CLINICAL EVIDENCE to

> Three key components should be taken into account when compiling
> CLINICAL EVIDENCE for every MDSW (Figure 1), and each is described
> below in further detail.

> **VALID CLINICAL ASSOCIATION / SCIENTIFIC VALIDITY** is understood as

> calculations) based on the inputs and algorithms selected, is
> associated with the targeted physiological state or clinical
> condition. This association should be well founded **or** clinically
> accepted (e.g. existence of a scientific framework or sufficient level
> of evidence as further elaborated in section 4.2 of this document).
> The VALID CLINICAL ASSOCIATION / SCIENTIFIC VALIDITY of a MDSW should
> demonstrate that it corresponds to the clinical situation, condition,
> indication or parameter defined in the intended purpose of the MDSW.
>
> **NOTE:** The VALID CLINICAL ASSOCIATION / SCIENTIFIC VALIDITY seeks
> to establish that there are sound scientific principles underpinning
> the use of the MDSW in question. The information provided for the
> establishment of the VALID CLINICAL ASSOCIATION / SCIENTIFIC VALIDITY
> should put forward the case that the MDSW has an association with a
> clinical condition or physiological state. This association may not
> always be readily established. Thus, the CLINICAL PERFORMANCE can
> serve as an additional input to the VALID CLINICAL ASSOCIATION/
> SCIENTIFIC VALIDITY from a clinical perspective for the specific
> intended purpose (see Annex I).
>
> *Example: MDSW that detects heart arrhythmia by analysing auscultation
> sound obtained by a digital* *stethoscope requires demonstrating*

> can be generated e.g. through literature research, professional
> guidelines, proof of concept studies, or manufacturer's own clinical

>
> In the first step, the manufacturer should verify the association

> situation or clinical parameter, as defined in the intended purpose of
> the MDSW. MDSW may include a multitude of clinical features governed
> by its intended purpose which require individual assessment.
>
> This association should be clinically accepted or well founded, which
> means accepted by the broad medical community and/or described in
> scientific (peer-reviewed) literature.
>
> VALID CLINICAL ASSOCIATION/ SCIENTIFIC VALIDITY can be demonstrated
> through the use of existing CLINICAL PERFORMANCE DATA while taking
> into account the generally acknowledged STATE-OF-THE-ART.
>
> VALID CLINICAL ASSOCIATION / SCIENTIFIC VALIDITY may further be
> demonstrated by the creation of new CLINICAL PERFORMANCE DATA in the
