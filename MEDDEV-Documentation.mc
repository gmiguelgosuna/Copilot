This document is intended to be a guide for manufacturers and Notified
Bodies on how to carry out Post-Market Clinical Follow-up (PMCF) studies
in order to fulfil Post-Market Surveillance (PMS) obligations according
to Section 3.1 of Annex II, Section 3 of Annex IV, Section 3 of Annex V,
Section 3.1 of Annex VI or Section 4 of Annex VII of the Medical Devices
Directive (93/42/EEC) and Section 3.1 of Annex 2, Section 3 of Annex 4,
Section 3.1 of Annex 5 of the Active Implantable Medical Devices
Directive (90/385/EEC). These Sections refer to requirements of Annex X
of Directive 93/42/EEC and Annex 7 of Directive 90/385/EEC,
respectively.
25 26 27
Attention is drawn to paragraph 8 of Article 15 of Directive 93/42/EEC
which spells out the provisions of Article 15 that are not applicable to
clinical investigations conducted using CE-marked devices within their
intended use.
28 29 30 31 32
Similarly when PMCF studies are conducted using CE marked devices within
their intended use, the provisions of section 2.3.5 of Annex X of
Directive 93/42/EEC do not apply. However, the provisions of Directive
93/42/EEC concerning information and notification of incidents occurring
following placing devices on the market are fully applicable.

1. Introduction
34 35
While clinical evidence is an essential element of the premarket
conformity
36
assessment process to demonstrate conformity to Essential Requirements,
it is
37
important to recognise that there may be limitations to the clinical
data available in
38
the pre-market phase. Such limitations may be due to the duration of
pre-market
39
clinical investigations, the number of subjects and investigators
involved in an
40
investigation, the relative heterogeneity of subjects and investigators
and/or the
41
controlled setting of a clinical investigation versus the full range of
clinical conditions
42
encountered in general medical practice.
43 44
A precondition for placing a product on the market is that conformity to
the relevant
45
Essential Requirements, including a favourable benefit/risk ratio, has
been
46
demonstrated. The extent of the data that can be gathered in the
pre-market phase
47
does not necessarily enable the manufacturer to detect rare
complications or problems
48
that only become apparent after wide-spread or long term use of the
device. As part of
49
the manufacturer's quality system, an appropriate post-market
surveillance plan is key
50
to identifying and investigating residual risks associated with the use
of medical
51
devices placed on the market. These residual risks should be
investigated and assessed
52
in the post-market phase through systematic Post-Market Clinical
Follow-up (PMCF)
53
study(ies).
54 55
Clinical data obtained from post-market surveillance and during PMCF
studies by the
56
manufacturer are not intended to replace the pre-market data necessary
to demonstrate
57
conformity with the provisions of the legislation. However, they are
critical to update
58
the clinical evaluation throughout the life-cycle of the medical device
and to ensure
59
the long term safety and performance of devices after their placing on
the market.
60 61
PMCF studies are one of several options available in post-market
surveillance and
62
contribute to the risk management process.
63 64 65
66 67
2. Scope
68 69
The objective of this document is to provide guidance on the appropriate
use and
70
conduct of PMCF studies to address issues linked to residual risks. The
intention is
71
not to impose new regulatory requirements.
72 73
PMCF studies are an important element to be considered in PMCF or PMS
plans. The
74
principles for PMCF studies set out in this guidance are not intended to
replace PMCF
75
or PMS plans. They are or may be applicable to PMCF studies conducted
for other
76
purposes.
77 78
This document provides guidance in relation to:
79
i)
the circumstances where a PMCF study is indicated;
80
ii)
the general principles of PMCF studies involving medical devices;
81
iii)
the use of study data (for example to update instructions for use and
labelling); and
82 83
iv)
the role of a notified body for medical devices in the assessment of
PMCF plans and of the results obtained from the plans as part of
conformity assessment.
84 85 86
This document does not apply to in vitro diagnostic devices.

5. Circumstances where a PMCF study is indicated
196 197
Following a proper premarket clinical evaluation, the decision to
conduct PMCF
198
studies must be based on the identification of possible residual risks
and/or unclarity
199
on long term clinical performance that may impact the benefit/risk
ratio.
200 201
PMCF studies may review issues such as long-term performance and/or
safety, the
202
occurrence of clinical events (e.g. delayed hypersensitivity reactions,
thrombosis),
203
events specific to defined patient populations, or the performance
and/or safety of the
204
device in a more representative population of users and patients.
205 206 207
Circumstances that may justify PMCF studies include, for example: 
innovation, e.g., where the design of the device, the materials,
substances,
208
the principles of operation, the technology or the medical indications
are
209
novel;
210

market clinical evaluation and re-certification has been completed;
211 212
significant changes to the products or to its intended use for which
pre-

high product related risk e.g. based on design, materials, components,
invasiveness, clinical procedures;
213 214

high risk anatomical locations;
215

high risk target populations e.g. paediatrics, elderly;
216

severity of disease/treatment challenges;
217

questions of ability to generalise clinical investigation results;
218

unanswered questions of long-term safety and performance;
219

results from any previous clinical investigation, including adverse
events or from post-market surveillance activities;
220 221

identification of previously unstudied subpopulations which may show
222
different benefit/risk-ratio e.g. hip implants in different ethnic
223
populations;
224

premarket follow-up time scales and the expected life of the product;
225 226 227
continued validation in cases of discrepancy between reasonable

risks identified from the literature or other data sources for similar
marketed devices;
228

interaction with other medical products or treatments;
229 230

verification of safety and performance of device when exposed to a
larger and more varied population of clinical users;
231

emergence of new information on safety or performance;
232

where CE marking was based on equivalence.
233 234
PMCF studies may not be required when the medium/long-term safety and
clinical
235
performance are already known from previous use of the device or where
other
236
appropriate post-market surveillance activities would provide sufficient
data to
237
address the risks.
238 239 240 241
242 243
6. Elements of a PMCF study
244 245
Post-market clinical follow-up studies are performed on a device within
its intended
246
use/purpose(s) according to the instructions for use. It is important to
note that PMCF
247
studies must be conducted according to applicable laws and regulations
and should
248
involve an appropriate methodology and follow appropriate guidance and
standards.
249 250
PMCF studies must be outlined as a well designed clinical investigation
plan or study
251
plan, and, as appropriate, include:
252
 clearly stated research question(s), objective(s) and related
endpoints;
253
 scientifically sound design with an appropriate rationale and
statistical analysis plan;
254 255
 a plan for conduct according to the appropriate standard(s);
256
 a plan for an analysis of the data and for drawing appropriate
conclusion(s).
257 258
Objectives of PMCF studies
259
The objective(s) of the study should be stated clearly and should
address the residual
260
risk(s) identified and be formulated to address one or more specific
questions relating
261
to the clinical safety or clinical performance of the device. A formal
hypothesis
262
should be clearly expressed.
263 264
Design of PMCF studies
265
PMCF studies should be designed to address the objective(s) of the
study. The design
266
may vary based on the objective(s), study hypothesis research question
and endpoints
267
and should be scientifically sound to allow for valid conclusions to be
drawn.
268 269
PMCF studies can follow several methodologies, for example:
270

the extended follow-up of patients enrolled in premarket investigations;
271

a new clinical investigation;
272

a review of data derived from a device registry; or
273

a review of relevant retrospective data from patients previously exposed
to
274 275
the device.
276
PMCF studies should have a plan describing the design and methodologies
277
appropriate for addressing the stated objectives. The clinical
investigation plan/study
278
plan should identify and where needed justify at a minimum:
279

the study population (corresponding to the CE-mark scope);
280

inclusion/exclusion criteria;
281

rational and justification of the chosen study design including use of
controls/control groups (where relevant; randomised or not);
282 283

the selection of sites and investigators;
284

study objectives and related study endpoints and statistical
considerations;
285

the number of subjects involved;
286

the duration of patient follow-up;
287

the data to be collected;
288

the analysis plan including any interim reporting where appropriate to
ensure continuous risk management based on clinical data; and
289 290

procedures/criteria for early study termination;
291

ethical considerations;
292

methods of quality control of data where appropriate.
293 294
The points above may not all apply to a retrospective data review.
295 296 297
Implementation of the PMCF study, analysis of data and conclusion(s)
298
The study should:
299 300 301 302 303 304 305 306 307
 be executed with adequate control measures to assure compliance with
the clinical investigation or study plan;  include data analysis with
conclusions drawn according to the analysis plan by someone with
appropriate expertise; and  have a final report with conclusions
relating back to original objective(s) and hypothesis/hypotheses.
308
7. The use of study data
309 310
The data and conclusions derived from the PMCF study are used to provide
clinical
311
evidence for the clinical evaluation process. This may result in the
need to reassess
312
whether the device continues to comply with the Essential Requirements.
Such
313
assessment may result in corrective or preventive actions, for example
changes to the
314
labelling/instructions for use, changes to manufacturing processes,
changes to the
315
device design, or public health notifications.
316 317
8
The role of the notified body in PMCF
318
When auditing the quality system of the manufacturer in the framework of
one of the
319
conformity assessment annexes of Directive 90/385/EEC or of Directive
93/42/EEC,
320
the Notified Body (NB) shall review the appropriateness of the
manufacturer's
321
general post-market surveillance procedures and plans, including plans
for PMCF, as
322
relevant.
323 324
The Notified Body shall verify that PMCF as part of the overall clinical
evaluation is
325
conducted by or on behalf of the manufacturer by appropriately competent
assessors
326
(as per section 10.3 of MEDDEV 2.7/1).
327 328
The NB shall verify that clinical investigations conducted as part of
PMCF plans are
329
conducted in accordance with the relevant provisions of Annex X (as per
Article 15.8
330
of 93/42/EEC), related guidance and relevant standards.
331 332
The NB shall as part of its assessment of a specific medical device5: 
333
verify that the manufacturer has appropriately considered the need for
334
PMCF as part of post market surveillance based on the residual risks
335
including those identified from the results of the clinical evaluation
and
336
from the characteristics of the medical device in accordance with
section 5
337
of the guidance; 
338
verify that PMCF is conducted when clinical evaluation was based
exclusively on clinical data from equivalent devices for initial
conformity
339
5
in accordance with Annex II.4, Annex II.7, Annex III, Annex V.6 and
Annex VI.6 of Directive 93/42/EEC and Annex II.4, Annex II.7, Annex III
and Annex V.6 of Directive 90/385/EEC
340
assessment and that PMCF addresses the residual risks identified for the
341
equivalent devices;
342

assess the appropriateness of any justification presented by a
manufacturer
343
for not conducting a specific PMCF plan as part of post market
surveillance
344
and seek appropriate remedy where the justification is not valid;
345

assess the appropriateness of the proposed PMCF plan in demonstrating
the
346
manufacturer's stated objectives and addressing the residual risks and
issues
347
of long term clinical performance and safety identified for the specific
348
device;
349

verify that data gathered by the manufacturer from PMCF, whether
350
favourable or unfavourable, is being used to actively update the
clinical
351
evaluation (as well as the risk management system);
352

consider whether, based on the specific device assessment, data obtained
353
from PMCF should be transmitted to the NB between scheduled assessment
354
activities (e.g. surveillance audit, recertification assessment);
355

consider an appropriate period for certification of the product in order
to set
356
a particular time point at which PMCF data will be assessed by the NB or
357
specific conditions relating to certification for subsequent follow up.
(This
358
decision may be based on the residual risks, the characteristics
presented in
359
section 5 and the clinical evaluation presented at the time of initial
360
assessment. Conditions the NB may consider could include the need for
the
361
manufacturer to submit interim reports between certification reviews, of
the
362
clinical data generated from the PMCF and post-market surveillance
363
system).

1 FOREWORD These guidelines on the Medical Device Vigilance System are
part of a set of Medical Device Guidelines that promote a common
approach by MANUFACTURERs and Notified Bodies involved in the conformity
assessment procedures according to the relevant annexes of the
directives, and by the National Competent Authorities charged with
safeguarding public health. They have been carefully drafted through a
process of consultation with various interested parties during which
intermediate drafts were circulated and comments were taken up in the
documents. Therefore, it reflects positions taken in particular by
representatives of National Competent Authorities and Commission
Services, Notified Bodies, industry and other interested parties in the
MEDICAL DEVICEs sector. The guidelines are regularly updated accordingly
with regulatory developments. The latest version of the guidelines
should always be used. This revision of these guidelines has: 
carefully considered and transposed into the European context the Global
Harmonisation Task Force (GHTF)1 international regulatory guidance
documents on vigilance and post market surveillance; addressed the
introduction of European medical device database EUDAMED; amended the
document in light of experience with previous clauses.
 
These guidelines are not legally binding. It is recognised that under
given circumstances, for example, as a result of scientific
developments, an alternative approach may be possible or appropriate to
comply with the legal requirements. Nevertheless, due to the
participation of the aforementioned interested parties and of experts
from National Competent Authorities, it is anticipated that the
guidelines will be followed within the Member States and, therefore,
work towards uniform application of relevant directive provisions and
common practices within Member States. However, only the text of the
Directives is authentic in law. On certain issues not addressed in the
Directives, national legislation may be different from these guidelines.
2
INTRODUCTION
These guidelines describe the European system for the notification and
evaluation of INCIDENTs and FIELD SAFETY CORRECTIVE ACTIONS (FSCA)
involving MEDICAL DEVICEs, known as the Medical Device Vigilance System.
The principal purpose of the Medical Device Vigilance System is to
improve the protection of health and safety of patients, USERs and
others by reducing the likelihood of reoccurrence of the INCIDENT
elsewhere. This is to be achieved by the evaluation of reported
INCIDENTs and, where appropriate, dissemination of information, which
could be used to prevent such repetitions, or to alleviate the
consequences of such INCIDENTs. These guidelines are intended to
facilitate the uniform application and implementation of the Medical
Device Vigilance System requirements contained within:  the Directive
for Active Implantable Medical Devices (AIMD), 90/385/EEC  the
Directive for Medical Devices (MDD), 93/42/EEC  the In Vitro Diagnostic
Medical Devices Directive (IVDD), 98/79/EC.

A list of the used abbreviations is listed in annex 10 4
MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance
FIELD SAFETY CORRECTIVE ACTION (FSCA), FIELD SAFETY NOTICE (FSN), USE
ERROR and ABNORMAL USE are concepts used in this guideline to enhance
and clarify the European Medical Device Vigilance System while promoting
harmonisation with GHTF provisions. The Medical Device Vigilance System
is intended to facilitate a direct, early and harmonised implementation
of FIELD SAFETY CORRECTIVE ACTION across the Member States where the
device is in use, in contrast to action taken on a country by country
basis. Corrective action includes, but may not be confined to: a device
recall; the issue of a FIELD SAFETY NOTICE; additional
surveillance/modification of devices in use; modification to future
device design, components or manufacturing process; modification to
labelling or instructions for use.
3 SCOPE These guidelines describe the requirements of the Medical Device
Vigilance System as it applies to or involves:     
MANUFACTURERs2 National Competent Authorities (NCA) the European
Commission Notified Bodies USERs and others concerned with the
continuing safety of MEDICAL DEVICEs
These guidelines cover the actions to be taken once the MANUFACTURER or
National Competent Authority receives information concerning an INCIDENT
involving a MEDICAL DEVICE. Information on INCIDENTs which should be
reported under the Medical Device Vigilance System may come to the
attention of MANUFACTURERs via the systematic procedure to review
experience gained from devices in the post-production phase, or by other
means (see annexes II, IV, V, VI, VII of MDD and annexes III, IV, VI and
VII of IVDD). The term "post-marketing surveillance" as referred to in
Annexes 2, 4, 5 in AIMD has the same meaning as the aforementioned
"systematic procedure". These guidelines cover Article 8 (AIMD),
Article 10 (MDD) and Article 11 (IVDD) outlining the obligations of
Member States upon the receipt of INCIDENT reports, from MANUFACTURERs
or other sources, concerning any MEDICAL DEVICE. They also include
guidance to National Competent Authorities about the issue and receipt
of information from National Competent Authorities outside Europe who
are involved in the GHTF National Competent Authority Report (NCAR)
exchange programme. These guidelines are relevant to INCIDENTs occurring
within the Member States of the European Economic Area (EEA),
Switzerland and Turkey with regard to: 
a) devices which carry the CE-mark

b) devices that do not carry the CE-mark but fall under the directives
scope (e.g. custom made devices)

c) devices that do not carry the CE mark because they were placed on
the market before the entry into force of the medical devices
directives.
2
including their Authorised Representatives and persons responsible for
placing on the market, see section 4 on definitions. 5
MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance

d) devices that do not carry the CE-mark but where such INCIDENTs lead
to CORRECTIVE ACTION(s) relevant to the devices mentioned in a), b) and
c).
These guidelines cover FIELD SAFETY CORRECTIVE ACTION relevant to
CE-marked devices which are offered for sale or are in use within the
EEA, Switzerland and Turkey. These guidelines make no recommendations on
the structure of the systems by which MANUFACTURERs gather information
concerning the use of devices in the post-production phase, of which the
Medical Device Vigilance System is an integral part. Such
recommendations are outside the scope of this document.
3.1
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
3.1.1   



FOR MANUFACTURERS
The MANUFACTURER or his AUTHORISED REPRESENTATIVE shall notify the
relevant National Competent Authority about INCIDENTs and FIELD SAFETY
CORRECTIVE ACTIONs when the reporting criteria are met (see section 5.1
and 5.4). The MANUFACTURER has the responsibility for investigating
INCIDENTs and for taking any CORRECTIVE ACTION necessary (see section
5.2 and 5.3). The MANUFACTURER should ensure that these guidelines are
made known to their AUTHORISED REPRESENTATIVEs within the EEA,
Switzerland and Turkey, persons responsible for placing devices on the
market and any other agents authorised to act on their behalf for
purposes related to medical devices vigilance, so that the
MANUFACTURERs' responsibilities may be fulfilled. The MANUFACTURER
should ensure that their AUTHORISED REPRESENTATIVE within the EEA,
Switzerland and Turkey, persons responsible for placing devices on the
market and any other agents authorised to act on their behalf for
purposes relating to medical devices vigilance, are kept informed of
INCIDENT reports as appropriate. Where an INCIDENT occurs as a
consequence of the combined use of two or more separate devices (and/or
accessories) made by different MANUFACTURERs, each MANUFACTURER should
submit a report to the relevant National Competent Authority (see
section 5.1) MANUFACTURERs must keep the Notified Body advised of issues
occurring in the post production phase affecting the certification (see
the relevant annexes of the relevant directives and section 7 of this
document). This would include relevant changes derived from the
vigilance system.
The act of reporting an INCIDENT to a National Competent Authority is
not to be construed as an admission of liability for the INCIDENT and
its consequences. Written reports may carry a disclaimer to this effect.
When placing on the market of a particular model of MEDICAL DEVICE
ceases, the MANUFACTURER's vigilance reporting obligations under the
Medical Device Directives remain. However, a MANUFACTURERs legal trading
arrangements change with mergers and acquisitions etc. Where the
vigilance and other post market surveillance obligations are being
transferred to another legal entity it is important that post market
surveillance activities continue and that Competent Authorities are
appraised of the implications and provided with new contact details as
soon as possible, so that any detrimental effects on the functioning of
the vigilance system are minimised. For a complete description of the
MANUFACTURER's role in the Medical Device Vigilance System, see section
5 of these guidelines.

MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance
3.1.2
FOR MANUFACTURERS OF DEVICES THAT ARE NOT INTENDED TO ACT DIRECTLY ON
THE INDIVIDUAL
Vigilance reporting may be more difficult for medical devices which do
not generally come into contact with patients. For example, for the
majority of diagnostic devices, IVDs and IVF/ART medical devices, due to
their intended use, it can be difficult to demonstrate direct HARM to
patients, unless the device itself causes deterioration in state of
health. HARM to patients is more likely to be indirect - a result of
action taken or not taken on the basis of an incorrect result obtained
with an IVD, a diagnostic device or as a consequence of the treatment of
cells (e.g. gametes and embryos in the case of IVF/ART devices) or
organs outside of the human body that will later be transferred to a
patient. Software qualified as medical devices may also lead to indirect
HARM (incorrect information generated by software). Any event which
meets all three basic reporting criteria A -- C listed under section
5.1.1 is considered an INCIDENT and must be reported to the relevant
National Competent Authority. Where the manufacturer of an IVD, IVF/ART
or diagnostic medical device identifies such an event that has or could
result in INDIRECT HARM (as defined in section 4.11) and that led or
might have led to death or serious deterioration in state of health,
they should submit a Manufacturer's INCIDENT Report (in accordance with
section 5.1.6) to the relevant Competent Authority. Any action taken by
the manufacturer to reduce a risk of death or serious deterioration in
the state of health associated with the use of a MEDICAL DEVICE that is
already placed on the market should be reported through a Field Safety
Corrective Action Report (as defined in section 5.4.4). Such actions,
whether associated with direct or indirect harm, should be reported. It
may be difficult to determine if a serious deterioration in the state of
a patient's health was or could be the consequence of an erroneous
result obtained with an IVD or a diagnostic device, the consequence of
an inappropriate treatment of reproductive cells with an IVF/ART device
or the consequence of an error by the USER or third party. In cases of
doubt a report should be submitted (see section 5.1). In the case of
potential errors by USERs or third parties, labelling and instructions
for use should be carefully reviewed for any possible inadequacy. This
is particularly true for devices used for self-testing where a medical
decision may be made by the patient. Inadequacies in the information
supplied by the MANUFACTURER that led or could have led to HARM to
USERs, patients or third parties should be reported. In particular, it
can be extremely difficult to judge events in which no HARM was caused,
but where HARM could result if the event was to occur again elsewhere.
3.1.3
FOR NATIONAL COMPETENT AUTHORITIES
For the purposes of Medical Devices Vigilance System, Member States are
represented by appointed National Competent Authorities, their vigilance
contact points being listed on the European Commission web site:
http://ec.europa.eu/health/medical-devices/links/vigilance_contact_points_en.htm
7
MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance

The National Competent Authority monitors the investigation of the
INCIDENT carried out by the MANUFACTURER. The National Competent
Authority should take any further action that may be necessary to
supplement the actions of the MANUFACTURER. Depending on the outcome to
the investigation, any information necessary for the prevention of
further INCIDENTs (or the limitation of their consequences) should be
disseminated by the National Competent Authority. Member States should
ensure that organisations and individuals involved in purchasing MEDICAL
DEVICEs and in the provision of health-care are aware that their
co-operation is vital in providing the first link in the vigilance
chain. In order to enhance the efficiency of the Medical Device
Vigilance System, National Competent Authorities should encourage the
reporting of INCIDENTs by the USER and other professionals involved in
the distribution, the delivery or putting in to service of the device.
This includes organisations and individuals responsible for providing
calibration and maintenance for MEDICAL DEVICEs. Such reports may be
made directly to the MANUFACTURER or to the National Competent Authority
as well depending on national practice.
  
Information held by National Competent Authorities in connection with
the Medical Device Vigilance System is to be held in confidence, as
defined by the relevant articles of the directives3. However, any
INCIDENT report should be available on request, and in confidence, to
the other European Competent Authorities and to other National Competent
Authorities participating in the GHTF exchange programme. For a complete
description of the National Competent Authority's role in the Medical
Device Vigilance System, see section 6 of this guideline.
3.1.4 
FOR USERS
USERs should report INCIDENTs with MEDICAL DEVICEs to the MANUFACTURER
or to the National Competent Authority depending on national practice.
Once corrective (or other) action is identified, hospital
administrators, medical practitioners and other health-care
professionals, and USER representatives responsible for the maintenance
and the safety of MEDICAL DEVICEs, can take the necessary steps. Such
steps should, where practicable, be taken in co-operation with the
MANUFACTURER.

For a complete description of the USER's role in the Medical Device
Vigilance System, see section 9 of this guideline.
4 DEFINITIONS 4.1
ABNORMAL USE
Act or omission of an act by the OPERATOR or USER of a MEDICAL DEVICE as
a result of conduct which is beyond any means of risk control by the
MANUFACTURER. Reference: EN IEC 60601-1-6
4.2
3

AIMD 15, MDD 20 and IVDD 20 8
MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance
Any natural or legal person established in the Community who, explicitly
designated by the MANUFACTURER, acts and may be addressed by authorities
and bodies in the Community instead of the MANUFACTURER with regard to
the latter's obligations under the directive.
4.3
CORRECTIVE ACTION
Action to eliminate the cause of a potential nonconformity or other
undesirable situation. NOTE1: There can be more than one cause for

data relating to registration of MANUFACTURERS and MEDICAL DEVICES
placed on the Community market,  data relating to certificates issued,
modified, supplemented, suspended,,withdrawn or refused,  data obtained
in accordance with the vigilance procedure,  data concerning clinical
investigations. Reference: Article 14a of MDD and article 10 of IVDD.
4.6
FIELD SAFETY CORRECTIVE ACTION (FSCA)
A FIELD SAFETY CORRECTIVE ACTION is an action taken by a MANUFACTURER to
reduce a risk of death or serious deterioration in the state of health
associated with the use of a MEDICAL DEVICE that is already placed on
the market. Such actions, whether associated with direct or indirect
harm, should be reported and should be notified via a FIELD SAFETY
NOTICE. NOTE 1: The FSCA may include -
the return of a MEDICAL DEVICE to the supplier; device modification;
device exchange; device destruction; retrofit by purchaser of
MANUFACTURER's modification or design change; advice given by
MANUFACTURER regarding the use of the device and/or the follow up of
patients, users or others (e.g. where the device is no longer on the
market or 9
MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance
has been withdrawn but could still possibly be in use e.g. implants or
change in analytical sensitivity or specificity for diagnostic devices).
NOTE 2 A MANUFACTURER can as part of ongoing quality assurance or an
investigation at the manufacturing site identify a failure of a device
to perform according to the characteristics specified in the information
for use provided by the MANUFACTURER. If the failure might lead to or
might have led to death or serious deterioration in the state of health
associated with the use of a MEDICAL DEVICE and has an impact on a
product that has already been placed on the market the MANUFACTURER must
initiate a FSCA. Examples of failure modes may include software
anomalies (e.g. incorrect correlation between patient sample and the
obtained result), invalid controls, invalid calibrations or reagent
failures (e.g. contamination, transcription errors and reduced
stability). NOTE 3 A device modification can include: □ permanent or
temporary changes to the labelling or instructions for use. For
example: - advice relating to a change in the way the device is used
e.g. MANUFACTURER advises revised quality control procedure such as use
of third party controls or more frequent calibration or modification of
control values for the device. - changes to storage conditions for
sample to be used with an IVD - advice issued to users relating to a
change in the stated shelf life of an IVF/ART device e.g. IVF/ART
MANUFACTURER informs users of an error on the labelling of their device
which indicates a shelf life longer than the validated shelf life for
the product. □ software upgrades following the identification of a fault
in the software version already in the field. (This should be reported
regardless of whether the software update is being implemented by
customers, field service engineers or by remote access) NOTE 4 Advice
given by the manufacturer may include modification to the clinical
management of patients/samples to address a risk of death or serious
deterioration in state of health related specifically to the
characteristics of the device. For example: - for implantable devices it
is often clinically unjustifiable to explant the device. Corrective
action taking the form of special patient follow-up, irrespective of
whether any affected un-implanted devices remain available for return,
constitutes FSCA. - for diagnostic devices (e.g. IVD, imaging equipment
or devices), corrective action taking the form of the recall of patients
or patient samples for retesting or the review of previous results
constitutes FSCA. NOTE 5: This guideline uses the definition of FSCA as
synonym for recall mentioned in article 10(1), paragraph 1b) of the MDD
and Article 11 IVD Directive since there is no harmonised definition of
recall.
4.7
FIELD SAFETY NOTICE (FSN)
A communication to customers and/or USERs sent out by a MANUFACTURER or
its representative in relation to a Field Safety Corrective Action.
10
MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance
4.8
HARM
Physical injury or damage to the health of people, or damage to property
or the environment. Reference: ISO/IEC Guide 51:1999
4.9
IMMEDIATELY
For purposes of this guideline, IMMEDIATELY means without any delay that
could not be justified.
4.10 INCIDENT "Any malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics
and/or performance of a device, as well as any inadequacy in the
labeling or the instructions for use which, directly or indirectly,
might lead to or might have led to the death of a patient, or USER or of
other persons or to a serious deterioration in their state of health."
Reference: Article 10 of the MDD Note 1: There is a similar definition
in Article 8 of the AIMD and Article 11 IVD Directive with minor wording
differences. Note 2: A description of "serious deterioration in the
state of health" is given in section 5.1.1. (C) of this document.
4.11 INDIRECT HARM In the majority of cases, diagnostic devices IVDs and
IVF/ART medical devices will, due to their intended use, not directly
lead to physical injury or damage to health of people (HARM -- see
section 4.8). These devices are more likely to lead to indirect harm
rather than to direct harm. HARM may occur as a consequence of the
medical decision, action taken/not taken on the basis of information or
result(s) provided by the device or as a consequence of the treatment of
cells (e.g. gametes and embryos in the case of IVF/ART devices) or
organs outside of the human body that will later be transferred to a
patient.
Examples of indirect harm include  misdiagnosis,  delayed diagnosis, 
delayed treatment,  inappropriate treatment,  absence of treatment 
transfusion of inappropriate materials. Indirect harm may be caused by 
imprecise results  inadequate quality controls  inadequate calibration
 false positive or  false negative results. 11
MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance
For self-testing devices, a medical decision may be made by the USER of
the device who is also the patient.
4.12 INTENDED PURPOSE The use for which the device is intended according
to the data supplied by the MANUFACTURER on the labelling, in the
instructions and/or in promotional materials. Reference: Article 1.2 (h)
of the IVDD and Article 1.2 (g) of the MDD
4.13 MANUFACTURER The natural or legal person with responsibility for
the design, manufacture, packaging and labelling of a device before it
is placed on the market under his own name, regardless of whether these
operations are carried out by that person himself or on his behalf by a
third party. Reference: Article 1.2 (f) of the IVDD and Article 1.2 (f)
of the MDD
4.14 MEDICAL DEVICE For the purpose of the Medical Devices Directives
90/385/EEC, 93/42/EEC and 98/79/EEC, any instrument, apparatus,
appliance, material or other Article, whether used alone or in
combination, including the software necessary for its proper application
intended by the MANUFACTURER to be used for human beings for the purpose
of: -
diagnosis, prevention, monitoring, treatment or alleviation of disease,
diagnosis, monitoring, treatment, alleviation of or compensation for an
injury or handicap, investigation, replacement or modification of the
anatomy or of a physiological process, control of conception,
and which does not achieve its principal intended action in or on the
human body by pharmacological, immunological or metabolic means, but
which may be assisted in its function by such means.
4.15 OPERATOR Person handling equipment.
4.16 PERIODIC SUMMARY REPORTING PERIODIC SUMMARY REPORTING is an
alternative reporting regime that is agreed between the MANUFACTURER and
the National Competent Authority for reporting similar INCIDENTs with
the same device or device type in a consolidated way where the root
cause is known or an FSCA has been implemented..
12
MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance
4.17 SERIOUS PUBLIC HEALTH THREAT Any event type which results in
imminent risk of death, serious deterioration in state of health, or
serious illness that requires prompt remedial action. This would
include:  events that are of significant and unexpected nature such
that they become alarming as a potential public health hazard, e.g.
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease (CJD).
These concerns may be identified by either the National Competent
Authority or the MANUFACTURER.  the possibility of multiple deaths
occurring at short intervals. Reference: GHTF SG2 N54
4.18 TREND REPORTING A reporting type used by the MANUFACTURER when a
significant increase in events not normally considered to be INCIDENTs
according to section 5.1.3. occurred and for which pre-defined trigger
levels are used to determine the threshold for reporting. NOTE: Appendix
C of GHTF SG2 document N54 '" Global Guidance for Adverse Event
Reporting for Medical Devices" provides useful guidance.
4.19 UNANTICIPATED A deterioration in state of health is considered
UNANTICIPATED if the condition leading to the event was not considered
in a risk analysis. NOTE: Documented evidence in the design file is
needed that such analysis was used to reduce the risk to an acceptable
level, or that this risk is well known by the intended USER.
4.20 USE ERROR Act or omission of an act, that has a different result to
that intended by the MANUFACTURER or expected by the OPERATOR of the
MEDICAL DEVICE.
4.21 USER The health care institution, professional, carer or patient
using or maintaining MEDICAL DEVICES.
5 MANUFACTURERS´ ROLE 5.1
INCIDENT REPORTING SYSTEM
The MANUFACTURER or their AUTHORISED REPRESENTATIVE must submit an
initial INCIDENT report to the National Competent Authority for
recording and evaluation. Each initial report must lead to a final
report unless the initial and the final report are combined into one
report. But not every INCIDENT report will lead to a corrective action.
13
MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance
As a general principle, there should be a pre-disposition to report
rather than not to report in case of doubt on the reportability of an
INCIDENT. Reference to the following considerations may be made in the
report, or should be kept on file by the MANUFACTURER in the case of a
decision not to report. INCIDENTs which occurred outside the EEA,
Switzerland and Turkey do not lead to a FIELD SAFETY CORRECTIVE ACTION
relevant to these geographic areas do not need to be reported. Incidents
which occurred outside the EEA , Switzerland and Turkey led to a FIELD
SAFETY CORRECTIVE ACTION relevant to the above-mentioned geographical
areas must be reported as a FIELD SAFETY CORRECTIVE ACTION. Where
appropriate, MANUFACTURERs should notify their AUTHORISED
REPRESENTATIVE, persons responsible for placing devices on the market
and any other agents (e.g. distributors) authorised to act on their
behalf of INCIDENTs and FSCA reported under the Medical Device Vigilance
System. If the MANUFACTURER is located outside the EEA, Switzerland and
Turkey, a suitable contact point within should be provided. This may be
the MANUFACTURER's AUTHORISED REPRESENTATIVE, persons responsible for
placing devices on the market or any other agent authorised to act on
their behalf for purposes relating to Medical Devices Vigilance. Any
report should not be unduly delayed because of incomplete information.
5.1.1 CRITERIA FOR INCIDENTs TO BE REPORTED BY MANUFACTURERS TO
COMPETENT AUTHORITIES Any event which meets all three basic reporting
criteria A -- C listed below is considered as an INCIDENT and must be
reported to the relevant National Competent Authority. The criteria are
that: A: An event has occurred This also includes situations where
testing performed on the device, examination of the information supplied
with the device or any scientific information indicates some factor that
could lead or has led to an event. Typical events include, but are not
limited to: a) A malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics or
performance. A malfunction or deterioration should be understood as a
failure of a device to perform in accordance with its INTENDED PURPOSE
when used in accordance with the MANUFACTURER's instructions. b) For
IVDs where there is a risk that an erroneous result would either (1)
lead to a patient management decision resulting in an imminent
life-threatening situation to the individual being tested, or to the
individual's offspring, or (2) cause death or severe disability to the
individual or fetus being tested, or to the individual's offspring, all
false positive or false negative test results shall be considered as
events. For all other IVDs, false positive or false negative results
falling outside the declared performance of the test shall be considered
as events. 14
MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance
c) Unanticipated adverse reaction or unanticipated side effect d)
Interactions with other substances or products e)
Degradation/destruction of the device (e.g. fire) f) Inappropriate
therapy g) An inaccuracy in the labelling, instructions for use and/or
promotional materials. Inaccuracies include omissions and deficiencies.
Omissions do not include the absence of information that should
generally be known by the intended USERs. NOTE: see ISO TS 19218 adverse
event type and cause/effect coding for further details on events. B: The
MANUFACTURER's device is suspected to be a contributory cause of the
INCIDENT In assessing the link between the device and the INCIDENT the
MANUFACTURER should take account of:    
the opinion, based on available evidence, of healthcare professionals;
the results of the MANUFACTURER's own preliminary assessment of the
INCIDENT; evidence of previous, similar INCIDENTs; other evidence held
by the MANUFACTURER.
This judgement may be difficult when there are multiple devices and
drugs involved. In complex situations, it should be assumed that the
device may have caused or contributed to the INCIDENT and the
MANUFACTURERs should err on the side of caution. C: The event led, or
might have led, to one of the following outcomes:  
death of a patient, USER or other person serious deterioration in state
of health of a patient, USER or other person.
A serious deterioration in state of health can include (non exhaustive
list): a) life-threatening illness, b) permanent impairment of a body
function or permanent damage to a body structure, c) a condition
necessitating medical or surgical intervention to prevent a) or b).
Examples: - clinically relevant increase in the duration of a surgical
procedure, - a condition that requires hospitalisation or significant
prolongation of existing hospitalisation. d) any indirect harm (see
definition under section 4.11) as a consequence of an incorrect
diagnostic or IVD test result or as a consequence of the use of an
IVF/ART device when used within MANUFACTURER´s instructions for use (use
errors reportable under section 5.1.5.1 must also be considered). e)
foetal distress, foetal death or any congenital abnormality or birth
defects.
NOTE : Not all INCIDENTs lead to death or serious deterioration in
health. The non-occurrence of such a result might have been due to other
fortunate circumstances or to the intervention of healthcare personnel.
15
MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance
It is sufficient that:  
an INCIDENT associated with a device happened, and the INCIDENT was such
that, if it occurred again, it might lead to death or serious
deterioration in health.
Examples of reportable INCIDENTs are given in Annex 1.
5.1.2
CONDITIONS FOR PERIODIC SUMMARY REPORTING UNDER THE MEDICAL DEVICE
VIGILANCE SYSTEM
There are a number of occasions when a National Competent Authority may
accept from a MANUFACTURER or AUTHORISED REPRESENTATIVE periodic summary
or trend reports, after one or more initial reports have been issued and
evaluated by the manufacturer and the National Competent Authority. This
should be agreed between MANUFACTURERs and individual National Competent
Authorities and submitted in an agreed format and frequency for certain
types of device and INCIDENT. When a MANUFACTURER has received the
agreement of a National Competent Authority to switch to periodic
summary reporting or trend reports, he shall inform the other concerned
CAs of the agreement and of its modalities. Periodic summary reporting
can only be extended to other competent authorities upon agreement of
the individual national competent authority. A form for Periodic Summary
Reporting is provided in Annex 6 .
5.1.2.1 INCIDENTS DESCRIBED IN A FIELD SAFETY NOTICE INCIDENTs specified
in the FIELD SAFETY NOTICE that occur after the MANUFACTURER has issued
a FIELD SAFETY NOTICE and conducted a field safety corrective action
need not be reported individually. Instead, the MANUFACTURER can agree
with the coordinating National Competent Authority on the frequency and
content of the Periodic Summary Report. The Periodic Summary Report must
be sent to all affected National Competent Authorities and the
coordinating National Competent Authority. Example: A MANUFACTURER
issued a FIELD SAFETY NOTICE and conducted a FIELD SAFETY CORRECTIVE
ACTION of a coronary stent that migrated due to inadequate inflation of
an attached balloon mechanism. Subsequent examples of stent migration
were summarised in quarterly reports concerning the FIELD SAFETY
CORRECTIVE ACTION and individual INCIDENTs did not have to be reported.
5.1.2.2 COMMON AND WELL-DOCUMENTED INCIDENTS Common and well-documented
INCIDENTs (identified as such in the risk analysis of the device and
which have already led to incident reports assessed by the MANUFACTURER
and the relevant National Competent Authority) may be exempted from
reporting individually by the National Competent Authority and changed
to PERIODIC SUMMARY REPORTING. However, these INCIDENTs shall be
monitored and trigger levels determined. Trigger levels for interim
reporting should also be agreed with the relevant National Competent
Authority. An interim report should be made whenever trigger levels are
exceeded.
16
MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance
Periodic summary reporting can only be extended to other competent
authorities when it has the agreement of individual national CA's.
5.1.3
CONDITIONS WHERE REPORTING UNDER THE MEDICAL DEVICE VIGILANCE SYSTEM IS
NOT USUALLY REQUIRED
5.1.3.1 DEFICIENCY OF A DEVICE FOUND BY THE USER PRIOR TO ITS USE
Regardless of the existence of provisions in the instructions for use
provided by the MANUFACTURER, deficiencies of devices that are always
detected (that could not go undetected) by the USER prior to its use do
not need to be reported under the vigilance system. This is without
prejudice to the fact that the user should inform the MANUFACTURER of
any deficiency identified prior to the use of a MEDICAL DEVICE.
Examples: 
The packaging of a sterile single use device is labelled with the
caution 'do not use if the packaging is opened or damaged'. Prior to
use, obvious damage to the packaging was observed, and the device was
not used.

Intravenous administration set tip protector has fallen off the set
during distribution resulting in a non-sterile fluid pathway. The
intravenous administration set was not used.

A vaginal speculum has multiple fractures. Upon activating the handle,
the device fell apart. The device was not used.

In an IVD testing kit a bottle labelled lyophilised is found to be
fluid, this is discovered by the USER prior to use.
5.1.3.2 EVENT CAUSED BY PATIENT CONDITIONS When the MANUFACTURER has
information that the root cause of the event is due to patient
condition, the event does not need to be reported. These conditions
could be preexisting or occurring during device use. To justify no
report, the MANUFACTURER should have information available to conclude
that the device performed as intended and did not cause or contribute to
death or serious deterioration in state of health. A person qualified to
make a medical judgement would accept the same conclusion. It is
recommended that the MANUFACTURER involves a clinician in making the
decision. Examples: 
Early revision of an orthopedic implant due to loosening caused by the
patient developing osteolysis, which is not considered a direct
consequence of the implant failure. This conclusion would need to be
supported by the opinion of a medical expert.

A patient died after dialysis treatment. The patient had end-stage-renal
disease and died of renal failure, the MANUFACTURER's investigations
revealed the device to be functioning as claimed and the INCIDENT was
not attributed to the device. 17
MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance
5.1.3.3 SERVICE LIFE OR SHELF-LIFE OF THE MEDICAL DEVICE EXCEEDED When
the only cause for the event was that the device exceeded its service
life or shelf-life as specified by the MANUFACTURER and the failure mode
is not unusual, the INCIDENT does not need to be reported. The service
life or shelf-life must be specified by the device MANUFACTURER and
included in the master record [technical file] and, where appropriate,
the instructions for use (IFU) or labelling, respectively. Service life
or shelf-life can include e.g.: the time or usage that a device is
intended to remain functional after it is manufactured, put into
service, and maintained as specified. Reporting assessment shall be
based on the information in the master record or in the IFU. Examples: 
Loss of sensing after a pacemaker has reached end of life. Elective
replacement indicator has shown up in due time according to device
specification. Surgical explantation of pacemaker required.

Insufficient contact of the defibrillator pads to the patient was
observed. The patient could not be defibrillated due to insufficient
contact to the chest. The shelf life of the pads was labelled but
exceeded.

A patient is admitted to hospital with hypoglycaemia based on an
incorrect insulin dosage following a blood glucose result. The
investigation found that the test strip was used beyond the expiry date
specified by the MANUFACTURER.
5.1.3.4 PROTECTION AGAINST A FAULT FUNCTIONED CORRECTLY Events which did
not lead to serious deterioration in state of health or death, because a
design feature protected against a fault becoming a hazard (in
accordance with relevant standards or documented design inputs), do not
need to be reported. As a precondition, there must be no danger for the
patient to justify not reporting. If an alarm system is used, the
concept of this system should be generally acknowledged for that type of
product. Examples:  An infusion pump stops, due to a malfunction, but
gives an appropriate alarm (e.g. in compliance with relevant standards)
and there was no injury to the patient.  Microprocessor-controlled
radiant warmers malfunction and provide an audible appropriate alarm.
(e.g., in compliance with relevant standards) and there was no
deterioration in state of health of the patient.  During radiation
treatment, the automatic exposure control is engaged.
Treatment stops. Although patient receives less than optimal dose,
patient is not exposed to excess radiation.  A laboratory analyser
stops during analysis due to a malfunction of the sample pipetting
module, but the appropriate error message was provided for the USER. An
intervention by the user or an immediate remote intervention by the 18
MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance
manufacturer allowed the analyser to resume the analysis, resulting in
correct results.
5.1.3.5 EXPECTED AND FORESEEABLE SIDE EFFECTS Expected and foreseeable
side effects which meet all the following criteria:    
clearly identified in the MANUFACTURER's labelling; clinically well
known* as being foreseeable and having a certain qualitative** and
quantitative predictability when the device is used and performs as
intended; documented in the device master record, with an appropriate
risk assessment, prior to the occurrence of the INCIDENT and clinically
acceptable in terms of the individual patient benefit
are ordinarily not reportable. It is recommended that the MANUFACTURER
involves a clinician in making this decision. If the MANUFACTURER
detects a change in the risk-benefit-ratio (e.g. an increase of
frequency and/or severity) based on reports of expected and foreseeable
side effects that led or might lead to death or serious deterioration of
state of health, this must be considered as a deterioration in the
characteristics of the performance of the device. A trend report must be
submitted to the NCA where the MANUFACTURER or its AUTHORISED
REPRESENTATIVE has his registered place of business. Rationale: At the
moment side effects are not covered by the INCIDENT definition in the
directive unless the change in the risk-benefit-ratio is considered as a
deterioration in the performance of the device. NOTES: * Some of these
events are well known in the medical, scientific, or technology field;
others may have been clearly identified during clinical investigation or
clinical practice and labelled by the MANUFACTURER. ** The conditions
that lead to the side effect can be described but they may sometimes be
difficult to predict numerically. Conversely, side effects which were
not documented and foreseeable, or which were not clinically acceptable
in terms of individual patient benefit should continue to be reported.
Examples: 
A patient who is known to suffer from claustrophobia experiences severe
anxiety in the confined space of a MRI machine which subsequently led to
the patient being injured. Potential for claustrophobia is known and
documented in the device product information.

A patient receives a second-degree burn during the use in an emergency
of an external defibrillator. Risk assessment documents that such a burn
has been accepted in view of potential patient benefit and is warned in
the instructions for use. The frequency of burns is occurring within
range specified in the device master record.
19
MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance

A patient has an undesirable tissue reaction (e.g. nickel allergy)
previously known and documented in the device product information.

Patient who has a mechanical heart valve developed endocarditis ten
years after implantation and then died. Risk assessment documents that
endocarditis at this stage is clinically acceptable in view of patient
benefit and the instructions for use warn of this potential side effect.
 Placement of central line catheter results in anxiety reaction and
shortness of breath. Both reactions are known and labelled side effects.
5.1.3.6 NEGLIGIBLE LIKELIHOOD OF OCCURRENCE OF DEATH OR SERIOUS
DETERIORATION IN STATE OF HEALTH INCIDENTs where the risk of a death or
serious deterioration in state of health has been quantified and found
to be negligibly small need not be reported if no death or serious
deterioration in state of health occurred and the risk has been
characterised and documented as acceptable within a full risk
assessment. If an INCIDENT resulting in death or serious deterioration
in state of health has happened, the INCIDENT is reportable and a
reassessment of the risk is necessary. If reassessment determines that
the risk remains negligible small previous INCIDENTs of the same type do
not need to be reported retrospectively. Decisions not to report
subsequent failures of the same type must be documented. Changes in the
trend, usually an increase, of these nonserious outcomes must be
reported. Example:  MANUFACTURER of a pacemaker released on the market
identified a
software bug and quantified the probability of occurrence of a serious
deterioration in state of health with a particular setting to be
negligible. No patients experienced adverse health effects.
5.1.4 TREND REPORTS On identifying a significant increase or trend of
events or INCIDENTs that are usually excluded from individual reporting
as per chapter 5.1.3 a report should be made to the relevant National
Competent Authority. To enable this, the MANUFACTURER should have
suitable systems in place for proactive scrutiny of trends in complaints
and INCIDENTs occurring with their devices. A trend report to the
National Competent Authority where the MANUFACTURER or its AUTHORISED
REPRESENTATIVE has its registered place of business should be made where
there is a significant increase in the rate of:   
already reportable INCIDENTs INCIDENTs that are usually exempt from
reporting events that are usually not reportable
irrespective of whether PERIODIC SUMMARY REPORTING has been agreed. A
form for Trend Reporting is provided in Annex 7 . 20
MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance
5.1.5 REPORTING OF USE ERROR AND ABNORMAL USE As with all reported
device complaints, all potential USE ERROR events, and potential
ABNORMAL USE events dealt with in paragraph 5.1.5.3, should be evaluated
by the MANUFACTURER. The evaluation is governed by risk management,
usability engineering, design validation, and corrective and preventive
action processes. Results should be available, upon request, to
regulatory authorities and conformity assessment bodies.
5.1.5.1 REPORTABLE USE ERRORS USE ERROR related to MEDICAL DEVICEs,
which did result in death or serious deterioration in state of health or
SERIOUS PUBLIC HEALTH THREAT, should be reported by the MANUFACTURER to
the National Competent Authority. USE ERRORs become reportable by the
MANUFACTURER to the National Competent Authority when a MANUFACTURER: -
notes a significant change in trend (usually an increase in frequency),
or a significant change in pattern (see appendix C of GHTF SG2 N54) of
an issue that can potentially lead to death or serious deterioration in
state of health or public health threat) - or initiates a FSCA to
prevent death or serious deterioration in state of health or SERIOUS
PUBLIC HEALTH THREAT
5.1.5.2 USE ERROR WHERE REPORTING UNDER THE MEDICAL DEVICE VIGILANCE
SYSTEM IS NOT USUALLY REQUIRED. USE ERROR related to MEDICAL DEVICEs,
which did not result in death or serious deterioration in state of
health or SERIOUS PUBLIC HEALTH THREAT, need not be reported by the
MANUFACTURER to the National Competent Authority. Such events should be
handled within the MANUFACTURER's quality and risk management system. A
decision to not report must be justified and documented.
5.1.5.3 CONSIDERATION FOR HANDLING ABNORMAL USE ABNORMAL USE needs not
be reported by the MANUFACTURER to the National Competent Authority
under the reporting procedures. ABNORMAL USE should be handled by the
health care facility and appropriate regulatory authorities under
specific appropriate schemes not covered by this document. If
MANUFACTURERs become aware of instances of ABNORMAL USE, they may bring
this to the attention of other appropriate organisations and healthcare
facility personnel.
5.1.6
DETAILS TO BE INCLUDED IN MANUFACTURER REPORTS
Annex 3 comprises the essential details of an INCIDENT to be included in
any report made by a MANUFACTURER, AUTHORISED REPRESENTATIVE or
person(s) responsible for placing on the market on their behalf to a
National Competent Authority and should be used for Initial, Follow-up
and Final Incident Reports. In the interests of efficiency, reporting by
electronic means (email, on-line database system, xml etc.) is
encouraged.
21
MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance
If the initial report is made by oral means (e.g. telephone), it should
always be followed as soon as possible by a written report by the
MANUFACTURER or the AUTHORISED REPRESENTATIVE. The report may also
include a statement to the effect that the report is made by the
MANUFACTURER without prejudice and does not imply any admission of
liability for the INCIDENT or its consequences.
5.1.7 TIMESCALE FOR THE INITIAL REPORTING OF AN INCIDENT Upon becoming
aware that an event has occurred and that one of its devices may have
caused or contributed to that event, the MEDICAL DEVICE MANUFACTURER
must determine whether it is an INCIDENT. The following time lines apply
in a case of: Serious public health threat: IMMEDIATELY (without any
delay that could not be justified) but not later than 2 calendar days
after awareness by the MANUFACTURER of this threat. Death or
UNANTICIPATED serious deterioration in state of health: IMMEDIATELY
(without any delay that could not be justified) after the MANUFACTURER
established a link between the device and the event but not later than
10 elapsed calendar days following the date of awareness of the event.
Others: IMMEDIATELY (without any delay that could not be justified)
after the MANUFACTURER established a link between the device and the
event but not later than 30 elapsed calendar days following the date of
awareness of the event. If after becoming aware of a potentially
reportable INCIDENT there is still uncertainty about whether the event
is reportable, the MANUFACTURER must submit a report within the
timeframe required for that type of INCIDENT. All report times refer to
when the National Competent Authority must first be notified. The
relevant contact points are available from the Commission's web site.
5.1.8 TO WHOM TO REPORT In general, the report should be made to the
National Competent Authority in the country of occurrence of the
INCIDENT unless specified differently in this guideline.
5.2
HANDLING OF USER REPORTS SUBMITTED TO THE MANUFACTURER BY A NATIONAL
COMPETENT AUTHORITY
If the MANUFACTURER receives a USER report from a National Competent
Authority he shall check this report against the reporting criteria of
chapter 5.1 and -
submit an Initial INCIDENT (or Follow-up/Final) Report to the relevant
National Competent Authority, if the event fulfils the relevant
reporting criteria or if the MANUFACTURER considers the event not to
fulfil the reporting criteria, provide the National Competent Authority
with a justification why this is not reportable to the National
Competent Authority with details of what use will be made of the
information. (e.g. added to complaints file).
22
MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance
5.3
INVESTIGATIONS
5.3.1
PRINCIPLES
The MANUFACTURER normally performs the investigation, while the National
Competent Authority monitors progress. Timeframe(s) for follow up and/or
final reports should be defined. If the MANUFACTURER is not able to
perform the investigation of an INCIDENT then he should inform the
National Competent Authority without delay. The National Competent
Authority may intervene, or initiate independent investigation if
appropriate. This should be in consultation with the MANUFACTURER where
practicable. Note: The above principles are generalised and do not take
account of interventions by judicial or other agencies.
5.3.2
ACCESS TO THE DEVICE SUSPECTED TO BE INVOLVED IN THE INCIDENT
A MANUFACTURER may consult with the USER on a particular INCIDENT before
a report has been made to the National Competent Authority (see section
6.1). The MANUFACTURER may also need to have access to the device
suspected to have contributed to the INCIDENT for the purpose of
deciding whether the INCIDENT should be reported to the National
Competent Authority. The MANUFACTURER should in such cases make
reasonable efforts to gain access to the device and may request support
from the Competent Authorities to gain access to the device so that
testing can be performed as soon as possible. Any delay can result in
loss of evidence (e.g. loss of short term memory data stored in the
device software; degradation of certain devices when exposed to blood)
rendering future analysis of the root cause impossible. If the
MANUFACTURER gains access to the device, and his initial assessment (or
cleaning or decontamination process) will involve altering the device in
a way which may affect subsequent analysis, then the MANUFACTURER should
inform the National Competent Authority before proceeding. The National
Competent Authority may then consider whether to intervene. Due to the
frequency of these requests, a statement introduced in the Initial
Vigilance report should cover this requirement, e.g. "The MANUFACTURER
will assume destructive analysis can begin 10 days following issuance of
this Initial INCIDENT Report, unless the National Competent Authority
contacts the MANUFACTURER within this time frame opposing a destructive
analysis of the device". NOTE: This section also applies to samples and
any other useful information associated with the INCIDENT.
5.4
OUTCOME OF AN INVESTIGATION AND FOLLOW-UP
5.4.1 PRINCIPLES The MANUFACTURER shall take the action necessary
following the investigation, including consultation with the National
Competent Authority and performing any FSCA - see section 5.4. The
National Competent Authority may take any further action it deems
appropriate, consulting with the MANUFACTURER where possible - see
section 6.2.3. 23
MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance
5.4.2
FOLLOW-UP REPORT
The MANUFACTURER shall provide a follow-up-report to the National
Competent Authority if the investigation time reaches the time line
given to the National Competent Authority within the initial report.
5.4.3
FINAL REPORT
There shall be a final report which is a written statement of the
outcome of the investigation and of any action. Examples of actions may
include:    
no action; additional surveillance of devices in use; preventive action
on future production; FSCA.
The report is made by the MANUFACTURER to the National Competent
Authority(ies) to whom the MANUFACTURER sent the initial report. If the
National Competent Authority performs the investigation then the
MANUFACTURER shall be informed of the result. A recommended format for
the MANUFACTURER's final report is given in annex 3.
5.4.4
FIELD SAFETY CORRECTIVE ACTION
The Medical Device Directives require the MANUFACTURER to report to the
National Competent Authority any technical or medical reason leading to
a systematic recall of devices of the same type by the MANUFACTURER.
Those reasons are any malfunction or deterioration in the
characteristics and/or performance of a device, as well as any
inadequacy in the instructions for use which might lead to or might have
led to the death of a patient or USER or to a serious deterioration in
his state of health. The term "withdrawal" used in the AIMD is
interpreted in the same way. This guideline uses the definition of a
FIELD SAFETY CORRECTIVE ACTION as a synonym for recall or withdrawal
since there is no longer a harmonised definition of these terms.
Removals from the market for purely commercial non-safety related
reasons are not included. In assessing the need for the FSCA the
MANUFACTURER is advised to use the methodology described in the
harmonised Risk Management standard EN ISO 14971: 2000. In case of
doubt, there should be a predisposition to report and to undertake a
FIELD SAFETY CORRECTIVE ACTION. FSCA taken on a basis of INCIDENTs
occurred outside the EEA, Switzerland and Turkey affecting devices
covered by the MDD are included in this guideline. FSCA should be
notified to the customers via a FIELD SAFETY NOTICE. 24
MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance
Where a Notified Body was involved in the conformity assessment
procedure of the device, it is recommended to inform them about the
FIELD SAFETY CORRECTIVE ACTION.
5.4.4.1 NOTIFICATION TO NATIONAL COMPETENT AUTHORITIES The MANUFACTURER
should issue a notification (see below) to the Competent Authorities of
all countries affected at the same time and also to the National
Competent Authority responsible for the MANUFACTURER or AUTHORISED
REPRESENTATIVE. Use the format recommended in annex 4. This notification
should include all relevant documents necessary for the National
Competent Authority to monitor the FSCA, e.g.  Relevant parts from the
risk analysis  Background information and reason for the FSCA
(including description of the device deficiency or malfunction,
clarification of the potential hazard associated with the continued use
of the device and the associated risk to the patient, USER or other
person and any possible risks to patients associated with previous use
of affected devices.)  Description and justification of the action
(corrective/preventive)  Advice on actions to be taken by the
distributor and the USER (include as appropriate:  identifying and
quarantining the device,  method of recovery, disposal or modification
of device  recommended patient follow up, e.g implants, IVD  a request
to pass the FIELD SAFETY NOTICE to all those who need to be aware of it
within the organisation and to maintain awareness over an appropriate
defined period.  a request for the details of any affected devices that
have been transferred to other organisations, to be given to the
MANUFACTURER and for a copy of the FIELD SAFETY NOTICE to be passed on
to the organisation to which the device has been transferred.) 
Affected devices and serial / lot / batch number range  In the case of
an action concerning lots or parts of lots an explanation why the other
devices are not affected  Identity of the MANUFACTURER/AUTHORISED
REPRESENTATIVE. MANUFACTURERs should also include a copy of the FIELD
SAFETY NOTICE to the Competent Authorities along with the notification.
This should be done before or at the same time as FSCA is being issued.
The MANUFACTURER or other responsible on his behalf should inform the
coordinating Competent Authority once the FSCA has been completed in
both, the EEA, Switzerland and Turkey. This should include information
on the effectiveness of the action per country involved (e.g.,
percentage of devices recalled) It is recommended that MANUFACTURERs
should provide a draft of the Field Safety Notification to a relevant
National Competent Authority, e.g. where the MANUFACTURER or the
AUTHORISED REPRESENTATIVE has his registered place of business, where
most of the affected devices are on the market or any other appropriate
National Competent Authority. Normally, the MANUFACTURER should allow a
minimum of 48 hours for receipt of comment on the Field Safety
Notification unless the nature of the FSCA dictates a shorter timescale
e.g. for SERIOUS PUBLIC HEALTH THREAT. 25
MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance
It is recommended to copy the FIELD SAFETY NOTICE to the Notified Body
involved in the conformity assessment procedure of that device.
5.4.4.2 CONTENT OF THE FIELD SAFETY NOTICE Unless duly justified by the
local situation, a uniform and consistent FIELD SAFETY NOTICE should be
offered by the MANUFACTURER to all affected EEA member states,
Switzerland and Turkey. The MANUFACTURER should use a distribution means
ensuring the appropriate organisations have been informed, e.g. by
confirmation of receipt. The FIELD SAFETY NOTICE should be on a company
letterhead, be written in the language(s) accepted by the National
Competent Authority(s) and include the following: 1. A clear title, with
"Urgent FIELD SAFETY NOTICE" followed by the commercial name of the
affected product, an FSCA-identifier (e.g. date) and the type of action
(e.g. see chapter 4 definition of a FSCA). 2. Specific details to enable
the affected product to be easily identified e.g. type of device, model
name and number, batch/lot or serial numbers of affected devices and
part or order number. 3. A factual statement explaining the reasons for
the FSCA, including description of the device deficiency or malfunction,
clarification of the potential hazard associated with the continued use
of the device and the associated risk to the patient, USER or other
person and any possible risks to patients associated with previous use
of affected devices. 4. Advice on actions to be taken by the USER.
Include as appropriate:  identifying and quarantining the device, 
method of recovery, disposal or modification of device  recommended
review of patients previous results or patient follow up, e.g implants,
IVD  timelines. 5. A request to pass the FIELD SAFETY NOTICE to all
those who need to be aware of it within the organisation and to maintain
awareness over an appropriate defined period. 6. If relevant, a request
for the details of any affected devices that have been transferred to
other organisations, to be given to the MANUFACTURER and for a copy of
the FIELD SAFETY NOTICE to be passed on to the organisation to which the
device has been transferred. 7. If relevant, a request that the
recipient of the FIELD SAFETY NOTICE alerts other organisations to which
incorrect test results from the use of the devices have been sent. For
example failure of diagnostic tests. 8. Confirmation that the relevant
National Competent Authorities have been advised of the FSCA. 9. Any
comments and descriptions that attempt to a) serve to play down the
level of risk in an inappropriate manner b) advertise products or
services 26
MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance
should be omitted. 10. Contact point for customers how and when to reach
the designated person. An acknowledgment form for the receiver might
also be included (especially useful for MANUFACTURER's control
purposes).
By following the recommendations above the clarity of FIELD SAFETY
NOTICEs will be improved. This will reduce the likelihood of Competent
Authorities either requesting MANUFACTURERs issue revised FIELD SAFETY
NOTICEs or issuing separate National Competent Authority communications.
A template for a FIELD SAFETY NOTICE is provided in annex 5.
6. RESPONSIBILITIES OF NATIONAL COMPETENT AUTHORITY The National
Competent Authority should send an acknowledgement of receipt of the
report to the sender. The National Competent Authority shall evaluate
the report in consultation with the MANUFACTURER, if practicable (see
section 5.2 and 5.3), advise as appropriate and intervene if necessary.
6.1 ACTIONS ON A REPORT FROM USERS OR OTHER SYSTEMS A report which
appears to meet the criteria of section 5.1.1, received by a National
Competent Authority from a USER reporting system or other source, shall
be copied by the National Competent Authority to the MANUFACTURER
without delay or translation. In doing so, patient confidentiality
should be maintained. Once the MANUFACTURER has been so informed and has
determined that the event fulfils the three basic reporting criteria of
section 5.1.1, the subsequent procedure is the same, as far as
practicable, as that described in section 5 of these guidelines.
6.2 RISK EVALUATION AND SUBSEQUENT ACTIONS
6.2.1 RISK EVALUATION BY THE NATIONAL COMPETENT AUTHORITY The risk
assessment of an INCIDENT or FSCA reported may include where relevant: 
Acceptability of the risk, taking into account criteria such as:
causality, technical/other cause, probability of occurrence of the
problem, frequency of use, detectability, probability of occurrence of
HARM, severity of HARM, INTENDED PURPOSE and benefit of the product,
requirements of harmonised European standards, the Medical Device
Directives safety principles (see annex I, clause 2 of the directives
93/42/EEC and 98/79/EC and clauses 5 and 6 of directive 90/385/EEC),
potential USER(s), affected populations etc.

Need for (what) corrective action 27
MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance

Adequacy of measures proposed or already undertaken by the MANUFACTURER
This assessment should be carried out in cooperation with the
MANUFACTURER.
6.2.2 MONITORING OF MANUFACTURERS SUBSEQUENT ACTIONS The National
Competent Authority normally monitors the investigation being carried
out by the MANUFACTURER. However, the National Competent Authority may
intervene at any time. Such intervention shall be in consultation with
the MANUFACTURER where practicable. Aspects of the MANUFACTURER's
investigation which may be monitored include, for example:    
course (direction the investigation is taking); conduct (how the
investigation is being carried out); progress (how quickly the
investigation is being carried out); outcome (whether the results of
device analysis are satisfactory ).
Facts which may be needed include, for example:   
the number of devices involved; the length of time they have been on the
market; details of design changes which have been made.
Liaison may be needed with:    
Notified Bodies (involved in the attestation leading to the CE marking);
USER(s); other Competent Authorities; other independent bodies, test
houses etc.
Competent Authorities may also monitor experience with the use of
devices of the same kind (for instance, all defibrillators or all
syringes), but made by different MANUFACTURERs. They may then be able to
take harmonised measures applicable to all devices of that kind. This
could include, for example, initiating USER education or suggesting
re-classification.
6.2.3 NATIONAL COMPETENT AUTHORITY ACTIONS For drug device combination
products regulated under the medical device directives, the National
Competent Authority receiving the INCIDENT report should establish a
link with any other relevant National Competent Authority or the EMEA,
if required. The National Competent Authority should take coordinating
action to ensure that an investigation is carried out if several
MANUFACTURERs are involved. National Competent Authority´s actions as a
result of a report of the MANUFACTURER or AUTHORISED REPRESENTATIVE may
include, for example:  no further action;  gathering more information
(for example by commissioning independent reports);  making
recommendations to MANUFACTURERs (for example to improve information
provided with the device); 28
MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance
     
keeping the Commission and other Competent Authorities informed (for
example on FSCA and other actions to be taken). The information may be
in the format of a National Competent Authority Report (see annex 8) or
similar; consulting with the relevant Notified Body on matters relating
to the conformity assessment; consulting the Commission (for example if
it is considered that re-classification of the device is necessary);
further USER education; further recommendations to USER(s); any other
action to supplement MANUFACTURER action.
6.3
CO-ORDINATION BETWEEN COMPETENT AUTHORITIES
6.3.1 CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE A COORDINATING NATIONAL COMPETENT AUTHORITY IS
NEEDED Competent Authorities should determine a single coordinating
National Competent Authority under the following circumstances:   
INCIDENTs of similar types occurring in more than one country within the
EEA, Switzerland and Turkey; FSCA conducted in more than one country
within the EEA, Switzerland and Turkey, whether or not a reportable
INCIDENT has occurred. information available on a FSCA conducted outside
the EEA, Switzerland and Turkey where there is uncertainty whether the
FSCA affects the member states within the EEA, Switzerland and Turkey or
not, e.g. a Competent Authority Report issued outside EEA Switzerland
and Turkey (for example via the GHTF NCAR Exchange Program) or
information published on a CA website outside the EEA , Switzerland and
Turkey.
6.3.2 DETERMINATION OF THE COORDINATING NATIONAL COMPETENT AUTHORITY The
co-ordinating Competent Authority should be the one that is responsible
for the MANUFACTURER or his AUTHORISED REPRESENTATIVE, unless otherwise
agreed between Competent Authorities e.g. the National Competent
Authority:  
which has a particular high interest in consulting other Competent
Authorities or is already undertaking investigation on INCIDENTs and
therefore initiates the coordination. in the State where the Notified
Body which made the attestation leading to CEmarking, is situated.
6.3.3 THE TASKS AUTHORITY
OF
THE
CO-ORDINATING
NATIONAL
COMPETENT
The coordinating National Competent Authority should, where relevant: 
inform the MANUFACTURER, the other affected Competent Authorities as
described in 6.3.1 and the Commission about taking the lead;
29
MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance
    
 
coordinate and monitor the investigation with the MANUFACTURER on behalf
of other Competent Authorities; consult with the Notified Body which
made the attestations which led to the CE marking and coordinate with
other National Competent Authorities within the EEA, Switzerland and
Turkey; discuss with the MANUFACTURER the principles, need for and
circumstances of corrective actions to be taken within the EEA,
Switzerland and Turkey ; reach agreement, where possible, with
MANUFACTURER and amongst National Competent Authorities about
implementing a uniform FSCA in all affected European countries; Feedback
to the Competent Authorities and the Commission the conclusion from
inquiries within the EEA member states, Switzerland and Turkey e.g. with
respect to multiple INCIDENTs in different countries which do not lead
to corrective actions at the latest with the closure of the file;
MANUFACTURER will be informed according to section 6.4; Agree with the
MANUFACTURER about content and periodicity of PERIODIC SUMMARY REPORTING
for INCIDENTs covered by FSCA Distribute the closure information.
Such an arrangement would not affect the rights of an individual
National Competent Authority to perform its own monitoring or
investigation, or to instigate action within its Member State in
accordance with the provisions of the relevant directives. In doing so,
the coordinating National Competent Authority and the Commission should
be kept informed about these activities.
6.3.4 SAFEGUARD CLAUSE The application of the Medical Device Vigilance
System does not affect the responsibilities of the Member States laid
down in the Safeguard Clause (Article 7 of AIMD, Article 8 of MDD and
Article 8 of IVDD). The Safeguard Clause procedures remain applicable
regardless of the Medical Devices Vigilance System.
6.3.5 DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION BETWEEN National COMPETENT
AUTHORITIES Information shall be disseminated between National Competent
Authorities and copied to the Commission when: A) a FSCA is performed by
the MANUFACTURER; B) a National Competent Authority requires the
MANUFACTURER to perform an FSCA or to make changes in an FSCA that the
MANUFACTURER has already initiated; C) there is a serious risk to the
safety of patients or other USERs, but where no corrective action has
yet been established, although measures are under consideration; D) the
MANUFACTURER does not provide a final report in a timely manner. This
information is called National Competent Authority Report (NCAR).
National Competent Authorities should use their discretion where
corrective action is taken by a MANUFACTURER which is not considered to
be essential to protect the safety of patients or other USERs. Under
these circumstances a National Competent Authority Report may not be
necessary. In cases of doubt there should be a pre-disposition on the
part of National Competent Authorities to disseminate the NCAR. 30
MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance
The NCAR concerning A) above should be disseminated by the National
Competent Authority responsible for the MANUFACTURER or its AUTHORISED
REPRESENTATIVE. The NCAR concerning B), C) and D) above should be
disseminated by the National Competent Authority requesting the FSCA or
changes within the FSCA, or identifying the serious risk and considering
measures, or expecting the final report, respectively. This NCAR should
be distributed by the NCA IMMEDIATELY (without any delay that could not
be justified) but not later than 14 calendar days after being informed
by the MANUFACTURER. The format for dissemination of information between
National Competent Authorities and the Commission is given in Annex 8
and is the GHTF SG2 N79 format with minor changes. The MANUFACTURER's
report may be circulated with the Competent Authority Report. The use of
Eudamed to exchange NCARs is mandatory. The appropriate "reason for
report" should be identified on the National Competent Authority
Report. National Competent Authorities receiving reports should pay
particular attention to the "reason for report" and any
"recommendations" given by the National Competent Authority issuing
the report. A number of reports may not require any immediate further
action. Wherever possible, National Competent Authorities should direct
enquiries relating to the investigation arising from the report to the
National Competent Authority providing the notification, who will
co-ordinate communication with the MANUFACTURER or Notified Body.
National Competent Authority Reports are intended for dissemination
between National Competent Authorities and the Commission only, and are
not for onward distribution to USERs or other interested parties unless
otherwise subject to national provisions and practices (Article 20 of
MDD and Article 19 of IVDD). Competent Authorities must, where
appropriate, consult the MANUFACTURER when preparing a NCAR, and must
inform the MANUFACTURER when one is issued.
6.3.6 DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION OUTSIDE National COMPETENT
AUTHORITIES by a National Competent Authority Careful consideration
should be given to the mode of communication, the drafting and the
dissemination of information by the National Competent Authorities. The
possible positive and negative effects of the information to be
disseminated should be considered when drafting advisory notifications
and when selecting the means and medium by which the message is
transmitted. When the MANUFACTURER has informed one or multiple National
Competent Authorities in advance of the start of an FSCA (see section
5.4) this information should be held confidential by the National
Competent Authority until the information becomes public. In general,
preference should be given to notification communicated directly to
medical practitioner or health-care facilities concerned, over
communication to the public. In some cases dissemination of information
directly to the public may be needed e.g. to suggest that patients or
USERs contact their medical practitioner for further, more specific
advice.
31
MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance
Where appropriate, it is recommended that the communication includes a
statement indicating that medical practitioners or other health-care
professionals should be consulted and that the information is intended
for medical professionals only. Consideration should be given to the
preparation of a press statement for use by all National Competent
Authorities. The above considerations apply also to dissemination of
information MANUFACTURER in consultation with the National Competent
Authorities.
by
the
Interfaces with communication media should be coordinated wherever
practicable between the MANUFACTURER and the National Competent
Authorities.
6.4 COMPLETION OF THE INVESTIGATION The National Competent Authority
shall place the MANUFACTURER's final report on file and make any other
observations necessary. The files investigation may then be endorsed as
"complete". If a National Competent Authority itself conducts an
investigation, the MANUFACTURER (and, where appropriate, other National
Competent Authorities) shall be informed of progress and of the results.
The MANUFACTURER's final report shall also be copied to any National
Competent Authorities who were informed by a National Competent
Authority of the initial report. The National Competent Authority should
inform the MANUFACTURER when the investigation is complete, or if no
investigation by the MANUFACTURER is required by the National Competent
Authority (Note: this does not preclude the MANUFACTURER investigating
as part of their ongoing quality assurance procedures). Records of
INCIDENT reports shall be retained to enable the investigation to be
reopened if necessary, and to facilitate systems for trend analysis.
7 THE ROLE OF THE NOTIFIED BODIES Even though the Notified Bodies do not
play a key operational role in the Medical Device Vigilance System, the
overall performance of the Medical Device Vigilance System is supported
by the Notified Body activity in the following areas:    
Assessment of vigilance procedures Audit of the implementation of the
vigilance procedures, and link with other systems e.g. Corrective and
Preventive Action (CAPA) , FSCA Assessment of the impact of vigilance
issues on the certification granted Liaise with the National Competent
Authority if required, e.g. specific investigations/audits based on a
request of the National Competent Authority
Further guidance on these areas is provided by Notified Bodies Operation
Group documents or Notified Body recommendations.
8 THE ROLE OF THE COMMISSION 32
MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance
The Commission shall ensure that appropriate coordination and
cooperation is put into place between the Competent Authorities of all
Member States to allow the Medical Device Vigilance System to deliver
the high level of protection for the health and safety of patients and
USERs. 
In order to reinforce a common understanding and a common approach
towards the identification and resolution of vigilance cases, the
Commission shall:

facilitate the exchange of experience and best practices between the
National Competent Authorities of the Member States, facilitate the
transmission of relevant data through the appropriate data exchange
system, when appropriate, in cooperation with National Competent
Authorities, develop and organise training programs.
 
9
USERS ROLE WITHIN THE VIGILANCE SYSTEM
There is no legal requirement within the directives obliging USERs to
have an active role in the Vigilance System. Yet for the successful
operation of the vigilance system their involvement is vital. It is
through the USERs that suspected INCIDENTs are made known to the
MANUFACTURERs and it is with their close involvement and co-operation
that the implementation of FSCAs is made possible. The involvement of
USERs is promoted and encouraged through the relationship the
MANUFACTURER develops with his customer (the USER). Annex 11 details
some key areas that the MANUFACTURER should promote with the USER. These
areas may also be reinforced by separate advice from National Competent
Authorities.
33
MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance
ANNEXES 10.1
ANNEX 1- EXAMPLES OF INCIDENTS AND FIELD SAFETY CORRECTIVE ACTIONS WHICH
THE MANUFACTURER SHOULD REPORT
The following examples are for illustrative purposes only, and are for
the guidance of the MANUFACTURER in determining whether a report should
be made to a National Competent Authority. The examples are intended to
show that there is a considerable judgmental element in the decision on
whether to report. EXAMPLES OF REPORTABLE INCIDENTS 1. A patient dies
after the use of a defibrillator and there is an indication of a problem
with the defibrillator. The INCIDENT should be reported. 2. A patient
receives a burn during the use, in accordance with the MANUFACTURER's
instructions, of surgical diathermy. If the burn is significant, this
should be reported as such a serious deterioration in state of health is
not normally expected. The INCIDENT should be reported. 3. An infusion
pump stops, due to a malfunction of the pump, but fails to give an
appropriate alarm; there is no patient injury. This should be reported
as in a different situation it could have caused a serious deterioration
in state of health. The INCIDENT should be reported. 4. An infusion pump
delivers the wrong dose because of an incompatibility between the pump
and the infusion set used. If the combination of pump and set used was
in accordance with the instructions for use for either pump or set, then
the INCIDENT should be reported. 5. An aortic balloon catheter leaked
because of inappropriate handling of the device in use, causing a
situation which was potentially dangerous to the patient. It is believed
that the inappropriate handling was due to inadequacies in the
labelling. The INCIDENT should be reported. 6. A catheter fractured
during insertion, with no suggestion of inappropriate handling. The
fracture occurred in such a position that the broken part could easily
be withdrawn. However, this was clearly a fortunate circumstance as if
the catheter had fractured in a slightly different position then
surgical intervention would have been necessary to retrieve the broken
end. The INCIDENT should be reported. 7. Glass particles are found by
the user in a contact lens vial. The INCIDENT should be reported. 8.
Loss of sensing after a pacemaker has reached end of life. Elective
replacement indicator did not show up in due time, although it should
have according to device specification. The INCIDENT should be reported.
9. On an X-ray vascular system during patient examination, the C arm had
uncontrolled motion. The patient was hit by the image intensifier and
his nose was broken. The system was installed, maintained, and used
according to MANUFACTURER's instructions. This INCIDENT should be
reported. 10. The premature revision of an orthopaedic implant is
required due to loosening. Although no cause is yet determined, this
INCIDENT should be reported. 34
MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance
11. User discovers that insufficient details are provided on cleaning
methods for reusable surgical instruments used in brain surgery, despite
obvious risk of transmission of CJD. The INCIDENT should be reported.
12. A batch of out-of-specification blood glucose test strips is
released by MANUFACTURER. A patient uses the strips according to the
MANUFACTURER's instructions, but the readings provide incorrect values
leading to incorrect insulin dosage. This INCIDENT should be reported.
13 A customer reports a wrong assignment of analytical results to
patient codes by an automated analyzer. An evaluation could reproduce
the effect and indicated that a data mismatch could occur. Due to the
data mismatch a patient may obtain a wrong diagnosis / treatment. This
INCIDENT should be reported. 14. During maintenance of a self-testing
analyzer for patients it was detected that a screw which places the
heating unit of the analyzer in exact position had come loose. Due to
this fact, it may happen that the heating unit leaves its position and
the measurement is performed under non exact temperature, which would
lead to wrong results. As this could lead to wrong treatment of the
patient this incident should be reported. 15. A user discovers that an
IVF culture medium is contaminated resulting in degeneration of the
cells. This INCIDENT should be reported.
EXAMPLES OF REPORTABLE FSCA. 15. The MANUFACTURER of a pacemaker has
identified a software bug in a pacemaker that has been placed on the
market. The initial risk assessment identified the risk of a serious
deterioration in state of health as remote. Subsequent failure results
and the new risk assessment carried out by the MANUFACTURER indicate
that the likelihood of occurrence of a serious deterioration in state of
health is not remote. The FSCA should be reported. 16. Fatigue testing
performed on a commercialised heart valve bio prosthesis demonstrates
premature failure, which resulted in a risk to public health. The FSCA
should be reported. 17. A defect is discovered in one (hitherto
unopened) sample of a batch (lot) of a contact lens disinfecting agent
that could lead to incidence of microbial keratitis in some patients.
The MANUFACTURER initiates a FSCA of this batch. This should be reported
as an FSCA. 18. During stability testing of a CRP test the internal
quality control found that after several months of storage false
increased values are measured with neonatal samples. This could lead to
the wrong diagnosis of the existence of an inflammatory illness and to a
wrong treatment of the patient. The MANUFACTURER issues information to
the field that a reduced onboard stability has to be taken into account.
The FSCA should be reported. 19. A MANUFACTURER has noticed that
starting from control lot XX a lower recovery is obtained and re-assigns
the control value. Users are informed of this new value by means of
warning stickers and a customer communication. The FSCA should be
reported. 20. A MANUFACTURER of an immunohematology analyzer received
complaints of an ABO blood grouping system results being attributed to
the wrong patient identification. The error proved to be due to the
analyzers software, which was subsequently updated. The FSCA should be
reported.
35
MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance
21. IVF/ART MANUFACTURER informs users of an error on the labelling of
their device which indicates a shelf life longer than the validated
shelf life for the product. The FSCA should be reported.

ANNEX 8 - NATIONAL COMPETENT AUTHORITY REPORT FORMAT v.01.13
NATIONAL COMPETENT AUTHORITY REPORT This form should be used for the
exchange of medical device information between NCAR participants only.
Completed forms should not be released to the public. 1. Is this report
confidential?
Yes [ ] No [ ]
Instructions for Filling in National Competent Authority Report The form
should be completed in English The NCAR participant filling in and
sending the NCAR is responsible for the quality of the content as well
as the appropriateness of sending such a message and the scope of its
distribution. Guidance on which issues should be selected for exchange
between NCAR participants is given in Section 5 above. Before releasing
any information, careful note should be taken of the SG2 N8 (Guidance on
How to Handle Information Concerning Vigilance Reporting Related to
Medical Devices). 58
MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance
This form should be completed by NCAR participants only, when exchanging
safety information about relevant measures and/or recommendations
relating to the prevention of adverse incidents concerning medical
devices. This form is designed for exchanging information between NCAR
participants; it should not be passed directly on to patients, users,
third persons or the public -- instead, if there is a need to
communicate to this audience another form of notice should be used. It
is not to be used for advising of single incidents, unless those
incidents have a clear implication for public health. In such cases, the
implied recommendation is for other NCAs to be aware and take such local
actions they find appropriate. If the NCAR report concerns a specific
manufacturer's device, then the manufacturer or authorized
representative should be consulted about the NCARs content and
distribution prior to it being sent -- preferably by providing a copy
for the manufacturer or authorized representative to comment on. This
will help to ensure the accuracy of the NCAR. An appropriate time frame
for receiving manufacturer's comments should be communicated. However,
this process should not be allowed to cause unnecessary delay. If an
NCAR concerns a range of devices from different manufacturers then the
NCA should make efforts to contact and obtain comment from all relevant
manufacturers or authorized representatives known to be on their
markets. There are differing reporting obligations for various NCAR
participants. In general, NCAR participants shall send reports directly
to the NCAR Secretariat for appropriate global distribution. The NCAR
secretariat will include the originator of the NCA report as
confirmation of distribution. The EEA States must exchange reports with
each other in accordance with current European Directives for medical
device. They should also send the report to the NCAR Secretariat for
further distribution to all other (non EEA) NCAR participants. There are
instances where reports are sent only to EEA participants of the NCAR
program. This may cause a discontinuity in the numbering of reports
received from EEA participants. When an NCAR is not to be distributed to
all NCAR participants a note of this should be made on the next NCAR
that is issued by the originating NCA to all NCAR participants (see
Notes on Field 26b). On the rare occasions-when there are time critical
issues of significant public health threat or concernin addition to
sending the report to the NCAR Secretariat, NCA's may send reports
directly to countries participating in the NCAR exchange who are known
to have the subject device in national distribution. In such
circumstances, the issuing NCA should ensure that the form is completed
fully and contains the correct sequential reference, preferably by
contacting the NCAR Secretariat. Field: 1-
Please be sure to check Yes or No for confidentiality. This tells the
recipient NCA if the information provided can be released publicly or
must be held strictly confidential. 2Use the rules for numbering
NCARs,(* use the ISO 3166 for country codes) which incorporates a
two-letter code of the issuing country to fill in this item. For
example: CA-200410-19-004 is a report from Canada sent 19 October 2004
and is the 4th report for 2004. Each NCAR should be given a new, unique
NCAR number. If an NCAR relates to a previously exchanged NCAR (i.e : is
an update), the original NCAR number should be specified in field 4. 3
Insert any local reference number used by your NCA relevant to this
report, here. 4If there have been previous NCARs exchanged relating to
this one, regardless of source, insert their NCA exchange numbers here.
5 Insert the manufacturer's reference/recall number here, if applicable.
6Identify person and organization sending the NCAR. This should be the
single point of contact, previously identified to the NCAR Secretariat.
7Identify contact person for any information / technical discussion of
the topic. 8-10 - Telephone, Fax and e-mail of person in (7) above. 59

taken to indicate the correct distribution for the NCAR. Confidential
NCARs should only be sent via the NCAR Secretariat to full NCAR
participants not all NCAR participants. EEA European Economic Area , EC
European commission and EFTA European federation trade associates NCAR
participants should indicate direct distribution of the NCAR to EEA
states, EC and EFTA NCAs in accordance European Medical Device
Directives. NCAs outside the exchange program that are being sent the
NCAR by the originating NCAR participant should also be listed. Where
NCAR report numbers are not sequential, participants should include the
number of the last report issued to all NCAR participants

ANNEX 11- GUIDANCE TO MANUFACTURERS WHEN INVOLVING USERS IN THE
VIGILANCE SYSTEM
Reporting Guidance What: Encourage users or those given specific
responsibility for reporting incidents that have occurred with medical
devices and that meet the criteria within these guidelines to report the
incidents to the Manufacturer and or to the Competent Authority in
accordance with national guidance. When: Encourage users to report all
adverse incidents as soon as possible. Serious cases ought be reported
by the fastest means possible. Initial incident reports should contain
as much relevant detail (e.g. equipment type, make and model) as is
immediately available, but reporting ought not be delayed for the sake
of gathering additional information. How: Encourage the user the use
reporting forms in accordance with national guidance and to provide
contact details when reporting to the manufacturer or the Competent
Authority. What to do with the device: All items, together with relevant
packaging materials, ought to be quarantined; they ought not be
repaired, or discarded. The device should be returned to the
manufacturer in accordance with their instructions unless otherwise
required by national or other legal requirements. In some member states
the Competent Authority may be required to be given opportunity then to
carry out its own investigation. Medical devices ought not to be sent to
Competent Authorities unless it has been specifically requested. Users
ought to contact the manufacturer to obtain information relating to the
procedure for returning the suspect device. The device should be
appropriately decontaminated, securely packaged, and clearly labelled,
including the CA or manufacturer reference number if needed. Further
local information: Encourage reporters to cooperate with the
manufacturer and the Competent Authority by providing further
information concerning incidents should they become available e.g.
relevant outcomes of internal investigations concerning the device or
patient outcomes e.g. subsequent death.
Field Safety Corrective Action Guidance Importance of FSNs: Field Safety
Notices are an important means of communicating safety information to
medical device users in all healthcare areas. Field Safety Notices may
also be used to provide updated information and request feedback. It is
therefore important that users are encouraged to develop effective
closed loop systems that ensure the dissemination of the Field Safety
notices and the timely completion of the actions outlined. Distribution:
Healthcare organisations should be encouraged to help ensure that the
FSN reaches all in the organisation that needs to be aware and/or take
the recommended action. Action: encourage users responsible for the
maintenance and the safety of medical devices to take the actions
advised in the manufacturer's field safety notice. These actions ought
to be taken in co-operation with the manufacturer where required. They
may also include associated actions recommended by the Competent
Authority in connection with the FSCA, including providing any requested
feedback.
63
MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance
Access to devices: Encourage users responsible for the maintenance and
the safety of medical devices to a) facilitate manufacturer access to
the device if this is required, and b) work with the manufacturer when
needing to balance the individual risks and benefits for any dependent
patients using affected devices.

Introduction
Pursuant to - section 6a of Annex I to Directive 93/42/EEC (amended by
Directive 2007/47/EC) and to - section 5a of Annex 1 to Directive
90/385/EEC (amended by Directive 2007/47/EC), the demonstration of
conformity with Essential Requirements for a medical device must include
a clinical evaluation, which is conducted in accordance with Annex X to
Directive 93/42/EEC or with Annex 7 to Directive 90/385/EEC. This
document promotes a common approach to clinical evaluation for medical
devices regulated by directives 90/385/EEC and 93/42/EEC. It does not
concern in vitro diagnostic devices. The depth and extent of clinical
evaluations should be flexible and appropriate to the nature, intended
purpose, and risks of the device in question. Therefore, this guidance
is not intended to impose device-specific requirements. This document
uses the terms "must", "shall", "have to" where these terms are
used in the Directives. "Should" is used in other instances.

Scope
This guide is not legally binding; only the text of the Directives is
authentic in law. It is recognised that under given circumstances, for
example as a result of scientific developments, an alternative approach
may be possible or appropriate to comply with the legal requirements.
Nevertheless, due to the participation of interested parties and of
experts from national Competent Authorities, it is anticipated that this
guide will be followed within the Member States, thereby supporting
uniform application of relevant provisions of EU Directives and common
practices. On certain issues not addressed in the Directives, national
legislation may be different from this guide. This guide is regularly
updated according to regulatory developments. The latest version of the
guide should always be used. This version is a complete revision of the
previous texts. The medical device legislation in Europe is currently
being significantly revised. A new Regulation of the European Parliament
and of the Council on medical devices will be published, which may
result in changes to important concepts or definitions relating to
clinical evaluation. Parts or all of this document are likely to be
revised. Some contents (such as contents about notified bodies) are
likely to be removed and integrated in other series of documents.

General principles of clinical evaluation
6.1. What is clinical evaluation? Clinical evaluation is a
methodologically sound ongoing procedure to collect, appraise and
analyse clinical data pertaining to a medical device and to analyse
whether there is sufficient clinical evidence to confirm compliance with
relevant essential requirements for safety and performance when using
the device according to the manufacturer's instructions for use. In
exceptional cases where an instruction for use is not required, the
collection, appraisal, and analysis are conducted taking into account
generally recognised modalities of use. The requirements for clinical
evaluation apply to all classes of medical devices. The evaluation
should be appropriate to the device under evaluation, its specific
properties, and its intended purpose. Benefits and risks should be
specified, e.g. as to their nature, probability, extent, duration and
frequency. Core issues are the proper determination of the benefit/risk
profile in the intended target groups and medical indications, and
demonstration of acceptability of that profile based on current
knowledge/ the state of the art in the medical fields concerned.
Clinical evaluation is a responsibility of the manufacturer and the
clinical evaluation report is an element of the technical documentation
of a medical device. For compliance with European medical device
directives, •
the clinical evaluation addresses the following Essential
Requirements: - Annex 1 sections 1, 2, 5 of AIMDD (for active
implantable medical devices), or - Annex I sections 1, 3, 6 of MDD (for
medical devices); see Appendix A7 (Analysis of the clinical data -
compliance to specific Essential Requirements);
•
the evaluation must follow defined and methodologically sound procedures
as described in: - Annex 7 of AIMDD (for active implantable medical
devices), or - Annex X of MDD (for medical devices);
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4
page 9 of 65
•
where demonstration of conformity with essential requirements based on
clinical data is not deemed appropriate, an adequate justification has
to be given. The justification is included in the clinical evaluation
report with contents according to: - Annex 7 section 1.5 of AIMDD (for
active implantable medical devices), or - Annex X section 1.1d of MDD
(for medical devices).
Conformity to the Essential Requirements can only be assumed when the
following items are aligned with each other: - the information materials
supplied by the manufacturer (the labelling, instructions for use,
available promotional materials, including accompanying documents
foreseen by the manufacturer) - the clinical evaluation (the device
description used for the clinical evaluation, other contents of the
clinical evaluation report) - the available clinical data (such as
results of Clinical Investigations, publications, PMS studies, etc.).
Particularly, evaluators should address if the following points are
adequately supported by sufficient clinical evidence: - the intended
purpose described in the information materials supplied by the
manufacturer (including for all medical indications); - the clinical
performance and benefits described in the information materials supplied
by the manufacturer (including, for example, any claims on product
performance and safety); - measures for risk avoidance and risk
mitigation described in the information materials supplied by the
manufacturer (including, for example the declaration of the residual
risks, contraindications, precautions, warnings, instructions for
managing foreseeable unwanted situations); - the usability of the device
for the intended users and the suitability of the information materials
supplied by the manufacturer for the intended users (including, if
applicable, for lay or disabled persons); - instructions for target
population groups (including, for example, pregnant women, paediatric
populations).
6.2. When is clinical evaluation undertaken and why is it important?
Clinical evaluation is conducted throughout the life cycle of a medical
device, as an ongoing process. Usually, it is first performed during the
development of a medical device in order to identify data that need to
be generated for market access. Clinical evaluation is mandatory for
initial CE-marking and it must be actively updated thereafter. Clinical
evaluation is necessary and important because it ensures that the
evaluation of safety and performance of the device is based on
sufficient clinical evidence throughout the lifetime that the medical
device is on the market. This ongoing process enables manufacturers to
provide notified bodies and competent authorities with sufficient
clinical evidence for demonstration of conformity of the device with the
Essential Requirements throughout its lifetime (for example for CE
marking, fulfilment of post-market surveillance and reporting
requirements, or during surveillance procedures).
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4
page 10 of 65
6.2.1. Clinical evaluation undertaken for the development of a medical
device Premarket research and development are guided by clinical
evaluation and risk management. Typically, manufacturers carry out
clinical evaluations to •
define needs regarding clinical safety and clinical performance of the
device;
•
in case of possible equivalence to an existing device, evaluate if there
are clinical data available and determine equivalence; for additional
information, see Appendix A1 (Demonstration of equivalence);
•
carry out a gap analysis and define which data still need to be
generated with the device under evaluation, whether clinical
investigations are necessary and if so, to define the study design; for
additional information, see Section 10 (Analysis of the clinical data)
and Appendix A2 (When should additional clinical investigations be
carried out?).
As the initial clinical evaluation identifies the questions to be
answered by a clinical investigation, the clinical evaluation process
should generally commence in advance of any clinical investigation1.
6.2.2. Clinical evaluation for initial CE-marking Clinical evaluation is
required to be carried out for the conformity assessment process leading
to the CE-marking and placing on the market of a medical device. The
purpose is to: •
document that there is sufficient clinical evidence to demonstrate
conformity with the Essential Requirements covering clinical performance
and clinical safety;
•
identify aspects that need to be addressed systematically during
post-market surveillance (PMS), e.g. in post market clinical follow-up
studies (PMCF Studies) required under the medical device directives.
Typically, these aspects include estimation of residual risks and
uncertainties or unanswered questions (such as rare complications,
uncertainties regarding long-term performance, safety under wide-spread
use).
6.2.3. Updating the clinical evaluation a. Frequency of updates The
manufacturer should define and justify the frequency at which the
clinical evaluation needs to be actively updated. When doing so, the
manufacturer should typically consider: •
whether the device carries significant risks (e.g. based on design,
materials, components, invasiveness, clinical procedures, high-risk
anatomical locations, high-risk target populations (e.g. paediatrics,
elderly), severity of disease/ treatment challenges).
•
whether the device is well established, taking into consideration: -
innovation;
1
Including for the planning of clinical investigations and production of
documents described in standard EN ISO 14155
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4
page 11 of 65
- relevant changes in clinical sciences, materials sciences or other
sciences related to the device under evaluation; - the current level of
confidence in the evaluation of clinical performance and clinical safety
of the device; the manufacturer should consider - the data available
from clinical investigations, PMCF studies, registries or other
systematic studies (including the number of devices used, if that usage
was representative of the usage in the market, the results to date); -
the total number of devices used so far in the market, and expected
reporting rates under the vigilance system. •
whether there are risks and uncertainties or unanswered questions, in
the medium or longterm, that would influence the frequency of updates.
•
design changes or changes to manufacturing procedures (if any).
The clinical evaluation is actively updated: •
when the manufacturer receives new information from PMS that has the
potential to change the current evaluation;
•
if no such information is received, then - at least annually if the
device carries significant risks or is not yet well established; or -
every 2 to 5 years if the device is not expected to carry significant
risks and is well established, a justification should be provided.
When involvement of notified bodies is required, updates are usually
coordinated with the notified body. Typically, they are aligned with the
timetable for surveillance audits and the renewal of the certificates.
b. General considerations on updating the clinical evaluation
Manufacturers are required to implement and maintain a PMS system that
routinely monitors the clinical performance and clinical safety of the
device as part of their quality management system2. The scope and nature
of such PMS should be appropriate to the device and its intended
purpose. PMS regularly generates new data (e.g. safety reports, results
from published literature, registries, PMCF studies, and other data
about device usage). Those data need to be evaluated for information
that has a potential to change the evaluation of the risk/benefit
profile, and the clinical performance and clinical safety of the device.
Those data are required to be fed into the clinical evaluation process
in a timely manner. In accordance with the Directives, the clinical
evaluation and the clinical evaluation report must be actively updated
with data obtained from post-market surveillance3. When updating the
clinical evaluation, the evaluators should verify: •
if the benefit/risk profile, undesirable side-effects (whether
previously known or newly emerged) and risk mitigation measures are
still

- compatible with a high level of protection of health and safety and
acceptable according to current knowledge/ the state of the art; -
correctly addressed in the information materials supplied by the
manufacturer of the device; - correctly addressed by the manufacturer's
current PMS plan; •
if existing claims are still justified;
•
if new claims the manufacturer intends to use are justified.
While clinical evaluation requires data from PMS activities, it also
generates new information that have to be fed into the PMS and risk
management process. Clinical evaluation can therefore result in changes
to the manufacturer's risk management documents, instructions for use
(IFU) and PMS activities. If the manufacturer concludes there is not
sufficient clinical evidence to be able to declare conformity with the
Essential Requirements, the manufacturer will need to : •
stop placing the devices on the market until conformity is restored, and
•
take necessary corrective and preventive action.
6.3. How is a clinical evaluation performed? The clinical evaluation is
based on a comprehensive analysis of available pre- and post-market
clinical data relevant to the intended purpose of the device in
question, including clinical performance data and clinical safety data.
There are discrete stages in performing a clinical evaluation: •
Stage 0: Define the scope, plan the clinical evaluation (also referred
to as scoping and the clinical evaluation plan).
•
Stage 1: Identify pertinent data.
•
Stage 2: Appraise each individual data set, in terms of its scientific
validity, relevance and weighting.
•
Stage 3: Analyse the data, whereby conclusions are reached about -
compliance with Essential Requirements (including ER1, ER3, ER6) on
performance and safety of the device, including its benefit/risk
profile, - the contents of information materials supplied by the
manufacturer (including the label, IFU of the device, available
promotional materials, including accompanying documents possibly
foreseen by the manufacturer), - residual risks and uncertainties or
unanswered questions (including on rare complications, long term
performance, safety under wide-spread use), whether these are acceptable
for CE-marking, and whether they are required to be addressed during
PMS.
•
Stage 4: Finalise the clinical evaluation report The clinical evaluation
report summarises and draws together the evaluation of all the relevant
clinical data documented or referenced in other parts of the technical
documentation. The clinical evaluation report and the relevant clinical
data constitute the clinical evidence for conformity assessment.
Each of these stages is covered in separate sections later in this
document (see the figure below). During the course of a clinical
evaluation the stages are often iterative. Indeed, the appraisal and
analysis stage may uncover new information and raise new questions, with
a need to widen the
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4
page 13 of 65
scope of the evaluation, refine the clinical evaluation plan, and to
retrieve, appraise and analyse additional data.
Figure: Stages of a clinical evaluation and references to sections and
appendices of this document.
6.4. Who should perform the clinical evaluation? The clinical evaluation
should be conducted by a suitably qualified individual or a team. The
manufacturer should take the following aspects into consideration: •
The manufacturer defines requirements for the evaluators that are in
line with the nature of the device under evaluation and its clinical
performance and risks.
•
The manufacturer should be able to justify the choice of the evaluators
through reference to their qualifications and documented experience, and
to present a declaration of interest for each evaluator.
•
As a general principle, the evaluators should possess knowledge of the
following: - research methodology (including clinical investigation
design and biostatistics);
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4
page 14 of 65
- information management (e.g. scientific background or librarianship
qualification; experience with relevant databases such as Embase and
Medline); - regulatory requirements; and - medical writing (e.g.
post-graduate experience in a relevant science or in medicine; training
and experience in medical writing, systematic review and clinical data
appraisal). •
With respect to the particular device under evaluation, the evaluators
should in addition have knowledge of: - the device technology and its
application; - diagnosis and management of the conditions intended to be
diagnosed or managed by the device, knowledge of medical alternatives,
treatment standards and technology (e.g. specialist clinical expertise
in the relevant medical specialty).
•
The evaluators should have at least the following training and
experience in the relevant field: - a degree from higher education in
the respective field and 5 years of documented professional experience;
or - 10 years of documented professional experience if a degree is not a
prerequisite for a given task.
There may be circumstances where the level of evaluator expertise may be
less or different; this should be documented and duly justified.
7.
Definition of the scope of the clinical evaluation (Stage 0)
Before a clinical evaluation is undertaken the manufacturer should
define its scope, based on the Essential Requirements that need to be
addressed from a clinical perspective and the nature and history of the
device. This is also referred to as scoping. The scope serves as a basis
for further steps, including the identification of pertinent data. The
manufacturer sets up a description of the device under evaluation, and a
clinical evaluation plan. A clinical evaluation is required to be
critical4. Therefore, it needs to identify, appraise and analyse both
favourable and unfavourable data. Depending on the stage in the
lifecycle of the product, considerations for setting up a clinical
evaluation plan should include different aspects. Typical examples are
listed below.

It is important to recognise that there is considerable diversity in the
types and history of technologies used in medical devices and the risks
posed by them. Many devices are developed or modified by increments, so
they are not completely novel. It may be possible to draw on the
clinical experience and literature reports of the safety and performance
of an equivalent device to establish the clinical evidence, thereby
reducing the need for clinical data generated through clinical
investigation of the device under evaluation. Similarly, it may be
possible to use compliance with harmonised standards to satisfy the
clinical evidence requirements for devices based on technologies with
well established safety and performance characteristics.

literature search and evaluation reports for PMS - incident reports sent
to the manufacturer (including the manufacturer's own evaluation and
report) - complaints regarding performance and safety sent to the
manufacturer, including the manufacturer's own evaluation and report -

reports •
Relevant pre-clinical studies (e.g. bench test reports including
verification and validation data)
With regard to those data: •
All data generated and held by the manufacturer need to be identified.
•
Complete data need to be entirely disclosed and made available to the
evaluators; this includes data from Europe and other countries; it
includes clinical studies as well as use data.
•
All data sets should be documented (adequately summarised11, appraised,
analysed and referenced) in the clinical evaluation report.
8.2. Data retrieved from literature Literature searching is used to
identify data not held by the manufacturer that are needed for the
clinical evaluation. Literature searching identifies potential sources
of clinical data for establishing: •
Clinical data relevant to the device under evaluation, which are data
that relate either to the device under evaluation or to the equivalent
device (if equivalence is claimed).
•
Current knowledge/ the state of the art. Includes applicable standards
and guidance documents, data that relate to benchmark devices, other
devices, critical components and medical alternatives or to the specific
medical conditions and patient populations intended to be managed with
the device. The data are typically needed in order to - describe the
clinical background and identify the current knowledge/ state of the art
in the corresponding medical field, - identify potential clinical
hazards (including hazards due to substances and technologies,
manufacturing procedures and impurity profiles), - justify the validity
of criteria used for the demonstration of equivalence (if equivalence is
claimed), - justify the validity of surrogate endpoints (if surrogate
endpoints are used).
The following aspects should be considered for literature searching:
11
to the extent that it can be critically reviewed by others
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4
page 18 of 65
•
The searching strategy should be thorough and objective, i.e. it should
identify all relevant favourable and unfavourable data. For some
devices, clinical data generated through literature searching will
represent the greater part (if not all) of the clinical evidence. Thus,
when conducting a literature review a comprehensive search should be
conducted. If a comprehensive search is not deemed necessary, reasons
should be documented.
•
Several searches with different search criteria or focus are usually
necessary to obtain the necessary data. For additional information, see
Appendix A4 (Sources of literature).
•
A literature search and other retrieval of data are carried out based on
a search protocol. The search protocol documents the planning of the
search before execution. For additional information, see Appendix A5
(Literature search and literature review protocol, key elements) and
Appendix A6 (Appraisal of clinical data - examples of studies that lack
scientific validity for demonstration of adequate clinical performance
and/or clinical safety).
•
Once the searches have been executed, the adequacy of the searches
should be verified and a literature search report should be compiled to
present details of the execution, any deviations from the literature
search protocol, and the results of the search.
•
It is important that the literature search is documented to such degree
that the methods can be appraised critically, the results can be
verified, and the search reproduced if necessary.
Abstracts lack sufficient detail to allow issues to be evaluated
thoroughly and independently, but may be sufficient to allow a first
evaluation of the relevance of a paper. Copies of the full text papers
and documents should be obtained for the appraisal stage. The literature
search protocol(s), the literature search report(s), and full text
copies of relevant documents, become part of the clinical evidence and,
in turn, the technical documentation for the medical device.
9.
Appraisal of pertinent data (Stage 2)
9.1. General considerations In order to determine the value of the data
identified in stage 1, the evaluators should appraise each individual
document in terms of its contribution to the evaluation of the clinical
performance and clinical safety of the device. Uncertainty arises from
two sources: the methodological quality of the data, and the relevance
of the data to the evaluation of the device in relation to the different
aspects12 of its intended purpose. Both sources of uncertainty should be
analysed to determine a weighting for each data set. The evaluators
should therefore:
12
•
identify information contained in each document,
•
evaluate the methodological quality of work done by the authors and from
that, the scientific validity of the information,
•
determine the relevance of the information to the clinical evaluation,
and
•
systematically weight the contribution of each data set to the clinical
evaluation.
For example different medical indications, target populations, intended
users.
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4
page 19 of 65
9.2. The appraisal plan To ensure systematic and unbiased appraisal of
the data, the evaluators should set up an appraisal plan that describes
the procedure and the criteria to be used for the appraisal. •
The appraisal plan typically includes: - criteria for determining the
methodological quality and the scientific validity of each data set. -
criteria for determining the relevance to the clinical evaluation
(relevance to the device and to the different aspects of its intended
purpose). - criteria for weighting the contribution of each data set to
the overall clinical evaluation.
•
The appraisal should be thorough and objective, i.e. it should identify
and attribute adequate weighting both to favourable and unfavourable
contents of each document.
•
The criteria adopted for the appraisal should reflect the nature,
history and intended clinical use of the device. They should be
documented and justified on the basis of current knowledge / the state
of the art, applying accepted scientific standards.
•
There are many acceptable ways, both qualitative and quantitative, by
which the appraisal can be carried out13. For many well established
devices and lower-risk devices, qualitative data may be adequate to
fulfil the requirements of the MDD and AIMDD. The evaluation criteria
should be adjusted accordingly.
•
The appraisal plan should be documented in the clinical evaluation
report.
9.3. Conduct of the appraisal The evaluators should •
follow the pre-defined appraisal plan strictly and apply its criteria
consistently throughout the appraisal;
•
base their appraisal on the full text of publications and of other
documents (not abstracts or summaries), so as to review all of the
contents, the methodology employed, the reporting of results, the
validity of conclusions drawn from the investigation or report, and
evaluate any limitations and potential sources of error in the data;
•
document the appraisal in the clinical evaluation report to the extent
that it can be critically reviewed by others.
9.3.1. How to evaluate methodological quality and scientific validity
The evaluators should examine the methods used to generate/ collect the
data and evaluate the extent to which the observed effect (performance
or safety outcomes) can be considered to be due to intervention with the
device or due to -
13
confounding influences (e.g. the natural course of the underlying
medical condition / regression to the mean, concomitant treatments)
For an example, refer to Appendix D of the GHTF SG5 document N2R8:2007
on Clinical Evaluation (Appendix D: A Possible Method of Appraisal)
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4
page 20 of 65
-
bias
-
random error
-
inadequate disclosure of information
-
misinterpretation
Some papers considered unsuitable for demonstration of adequate
performance because of poor elements of the study design or inadequate
analysis may still contain data suitable for safety analysis or vice
versa. Examples of aspects that can be taken into consideration for
evaluating the methodological quality and the scientific validity of the
evidence are detailed below.
a. Study design of pre-market and post-market clinical investigations
Considerations may need to include: •
adequacy of the sample size and power calculation
•
adequacy and relevance of endpoints (including validity of surrogate
endpoints, if used)
•
adequacy of applied controls (including choice of the study type and of
comparators, if applicable)
•
prospective randomisation of patients (in case of multiple treatment
arms)
•
adequacy of inclusion and exclusion criteria, and of stratification of
patients (e.g. in respect to age, medical indication, severity of the
condition, gender, other prognostic factors)
•
distribution of prognostic factors (in case of multiple groups, were the
groups comparable for these factors?)
•
blinding of patients (may include use of sham devices or sham surgery),
professional users, outcome assessors (blinded endpoints)
•
adequacy of the follow-up period, including if follow-up was long enough
for outcomes to occur, and if follow-up was frequent enough to detect
temporary side effects and complications (such as prolonged wound
healing)
•
reliability of the methods used for quantifying symptoms and outcomes
(including validation of the methods)
•
adequate recording and reporting of serious adverse events and device
deficiencies
•
adequate handling of medications and concomitant interventions
•
adequacy of procedures for retrieving complete information (e.g.
procedures to be applied when contacts with patients are lost,
disclosure of reasons for patients leaving the study, conduct of
sensitivity analysis for determining if missing data affect conclusions)
The evaluators should verify whether clinical investigations have been
defined in such a way as to confirm or refute the manufacturer's claims
for the device; and whether these investigations include an adequate
number of observations to guarantee the scientific validity of the
conclusions.
b. Additional aspects for appraisal of the quality of clinical
investigations generated and held by the manufacturer Where a clinical
investigation has been carried out by or on behalf of a manufacturer, it
is expected that documentation relating to the design, ethical and
regulatory approvals, conduct, results and conclusions of the
investigation needed for the clinical evaluation will be available for
consideration, as appropriate. These may include:
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4
page 21 of 65
-
the clinical investigation plan; clinical investigation plan amendments
and the rationale for these changes; case report form templates,
monitoring and audit records; the relevant ethics committee
documentation; regulatory authority approvals as required by applicable
regulations; the signed and dated clinical investigation report (for
investigations that are terminated); the latest intermediate report
available and the latest collation on serious adverse events (for
investigations that are ongoing); - when a clinical investigation is
conducted outside of the EU, an analysis whether the results are
transferable to the European population; - a gap analysis, when a
clinical investigation is conducted to standards different from EN ISO
14155; the gap analysis should contain sufficient information to be read
and understood by an independent party. The clinical investigation plan
sets out how the study was intended to be conducted. It contains
important information about the study design such as the selection and
assignment of participants to treatment, masking (blinding of
participants and investigators) and measurement of responses to
treatment, which may be important sources of bias that can be assessed
and possibly discounted when trying to determine the actual performance
of the device. In addition the clinical investigation plan sets out the
intended participant follow-up, approaches to statistical analyses and
methods for recording outcomes, which may impact on the quality,
completeness and validity of results obtained for performance and safety
outcomes. Also, by having the clinical investigation plan, its
amendments and the clinical investigation report available, the
evaluators will be able to assess the extent to which the investigation
was conducted as planned and, where deviations from the original plan
have occurred, the impact those deviations had on the veracity of the
data generated and the conclusions that can be drawn from the
investigation about the performance and safety of the device. The
clinical investigation report should be signed by the sponsor and the
coordinating or principal investigator to provide assurance that the
report is an accurate reflection of the conduct and results of the
clinical investigation. Another important consideration of the
evaluation will be to assess whether the conduct of the investigation
was in accordance with applicable regulations, and in accordance with
the current applicable ethical standards that have their origin in the
Declaration of Helsinki. Clinical investigations not in compliance with
applicable ethical standards, medical device standards (for example EN
ISO 14155 or comparable standards) or regulations should not be used for
demonstration of performance and/or safety of the device. The reasons
should be noted in the report. c. Information derived from vigilance
data, device registry data, case series, patient dossiers, and other use
data Evaluators need to consider significant differences between sources
of information in respect to: •
procedures used for retrieving information about outcomes
•
quality aspects of registers and patient dossiers
In case of information based on vigilance reporting, evaluators should
consider that expected undesirable side-effects and complications of
devices are not reportable under the vigilance reporting system.
Under-reporting or lack of reporting of expected side effects or
complications by users is common. Therefore, the vigilance system does
not typically deliver adequate information about the true frequency of
expected undesirable side-effects and complications. Systematic
scientific data are needed for such purposes. Vigilance data, including
trend analysis, should be used for identification of unexpected risks.
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4
page 22 of 65
In case of information based on device registries, case series,
retrospective analyses of patient dossiers, and other use data, the
retrieval of information about outcomes may be incomplete and unreliable
(have all the patients been considered? are the patients representative
of the use of the device? did the register/ professional lose contact
with patients if they moved on to different professionals? was there a
passive or active follow-up of patients by the professionals involved?
for how long?). Significant differences may exist between device
registries. For instance, they may offer an important or limited
coverage of a country. The evaluators should take into account the
possibility of patients leaving the coverage of a registry or the
follow-up of a professional when experiencing serious adverse outcomes.
In routine practice, there are also significant differences in the
duration of the follow-up of patients by surgeons and other
professionals, and in the quality of patient dossiers and data
retrieval. For clinical experience data it is important that any reports
or collations of data (e.g. the manufacturer's PMS reports) contain
sufficient information for the evaluators to be able to undertake a
rational and objective evaluation of the information and make a
conclusion about its significance with respect to the performance and
safety of the device in question. Reports of clinical experience that
are not adequately supported by data, such as anecdotal reports or
opinions, may contribute to the evaluation, e.g. for the identification
of unexpected risks, but should not be used as proof of adequate
clinical performance and clinical safety of the device. d. Data
processing and statistics Aspects to consider may include: •
suitability of methods for data processing (transforming data that are
suitable for analysis), converting data to a consistent format,
reconstructing missing statistics from other statistics, dealing with
missing data;
•
exclusions from the analysis and their implications (including
disclosure and adequacy of the intention-to-treat and per-protocol
populations, disclosure of results from both the intention-to-treat and
the per-protocol populations);
•
adequacy of statistical methods.
e. Quality assurance •
compliance with Good clinical practice (GCP), such as EN ISO 14155 or
equivalent standards;
•
compliance with the clinical investigation plan, independent monitoring
and auditing;
•
compliance with legal requirements.
While a publication in a renowned peer reviewed scientific journal is
generally accepted as an indicator of scientific quality, such
publication is not considered an acceptable reason for bypassing or
reducing appraisal activities. f. Report quality Evaluators should
consider: •
adequacy of disclosure of methods used
•
adequacy of disclosure of data, including - completeness of the
reporting of adverse events and outcomes - sufficient description about
the distribution of prognostic factors in the study population and in
different study arms - disclosure of all the results the study was
originally designed to generate
•
validity of conclusions drawn by the authors (example: conclusions not
in line with the results section of the document)
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4
page 23 of 65
Possible conflicts of interest of the authors of the publications should
also be taken into consideration. It is recognised that, where
manufacturers source clinical investigation data reported in the
scientific literature, the documentation readily available to the
manufacturer for inclusion in the clinical evaluation is likely to be no
more than the published paper itself. In case of missing information,
the rating of the methodological quality of a publication may need to be
downscaled. For additional information see Appendix A6 (Appraisal of
clinical data - examples of studies that lack scientific validity for
demonstration of adequate clinical performance and/or clinical safety).
9.3.2. How to determine the relevance of a data set for the clinical
evaluation When evaluating the relevance of collected data it is
important to consider whether the data are intended to directly
demonstrate adequate clinical performance and clinical safety of the
device (often referred to as pivotal data), or whether the data serves
an indirect supportive role. a. Pivotal data •
Pivotal data must have the data quality necessary for demonstration of
adequate clinical performance and clinical safety of the device under
evaluation (see Appendix A6, Appraisal of clinical data - examples of
studies that lack scientific validity for demonstration of adequate
clinical performance and/or clinical safety);
•
be generated either with the device under evaluation or with an
equivalent device used in its intended purpose (for an equivalent
device, equivalence must be demonstrated; see Appendix A1, Demonstration
of equivalence).
b. Other data Data that are not pivotal are generally appraised and
weighted for their contribution for purposes such as: •
identifying and defining the current knowledge/ state of the art in the
corresponding medical field, so as to define acceptability criteria for
the evaluation of the benefit/risk profile and of specific side-effects
of the device under evaluation;
•
identifying hazards (including hazards due to substances and
technologies), individual case reports may be used for identification of
new and previously unknown hazards that are associated with the device;
•
justifying the validity of criteria used for the demonstration of
equivalence (if equivalence is claimed);
•
justifying the validity of surrogate endpoints (if surrogate endpoints
are used).
•
providing input for the planning of pivotal studies.
The corresponding information is, in general, summarised in a literature
review section of the clinical evaluation report. c. Aspects to consider
when determining relevance The table below shows examples of aspects
that could be used for determining if and in what respect data are
relevant to the clinical evaluation.

9.3.3. How to weight the contribution of each data set Based on their
scientific validity and relevance, the data should be weighted according
to their relative contributions. Due to the diversity of medical
devices, there is no single, well established method for weighting
clinical data: •
the evaluators should identify appropriate criteria to be applied for a
specific evaluation;
•
these pre-defined criteria should be followed strictly by the
evaluators.
Typically, clinical data should receive the highest weighting, when
generated through a well designed and monitored randomized controlled
clinical investigation (also called randomised controlled trial),
conducted with the device under evaluation in its intended purpose, with
patients and users that are representative of the target population.
Note: It is acknowledged that randomized clinical investigations may not
always be feasible and/or appropriate and the use of alternative study
designs may provide relevant clinical information of adequate weighting.
When rejecting evidence, the evaluators should document the reasons
(both for studies and reports that have been generated and are held by
the manufacturer, and for other documents identified during Stage 1).
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4
page 26 of 65
10. Analysis of the clinical data (Stage 3) 10.1. General considerations
The goal of the analysis stage is to determine if the appraised data
sets available for a medical device collectively demonstrate compliance
with each of the Essential Requirements pertaining to the clinical
performance and clinical safety of the device, when the device is used
according to its intended purpose. In order to demonstrate compliance,
the evaluators should •
use sound methods;
•
make a comprehensive analysis;
•
determine if additional clinical investigations or other measures are
necessary;
•
determine PMCF needs.
10.2. Specific considerations a. Use sound methods A literature review
that describes current knowledge/ the state of the art should be
prepared with relevant literature identified during Stage 1 and
appraised during Stage 2. Weighting criteria developed and assigned
during the appraisal stage can be used to identify those sets of data,
which may be considered to be pivotal. The methods available for
analysing clinical data generally are either qualitative or
quantitative. Depending on the nature of the medical device and the
circumstances, it is likely that qualitative (i.e. descriptive) methods
will need to be used for some devices. Reliance on qualitative methods
should be justified. Generally, available clinical data such as numbers
of incidents in the post market phase should be assessed quantitatively
in relation to current knowledge/ the state of the art. The results of
the pivotal datasets should be explored, looking for consistency of
results across particular device performance characteristics and
identified risks. If the different datasets report similar outcomes,
confidence in the robustness increases. If different results are
observed across the datasets, it will be helpful to determine the reason
for such differences. Regardless, all data sets should be considered and
included. The reviewers should take into account the weighting
attributed to data sets during Stage 2 when addressing conflicting
information. Where relevant, a rationale should be given for the lack of
value of a data set to the evaluation. In general, data that are not
methodologically sound (such as single patient reports) should not be
used for demonstration of adequate clinical performance and clinical
safety of a device. For additional information, see Appendix A6
(Appraisal of clinical data - examples of studies that lack scientific
validity for demonstration of adequate clinical performance and/or
clinical safety). In exceptional situations, when an evaluation is based
on limited data, this shall be described and justified in the clinical
evaluation report. See additional information and specific
considerations in Appendix A8 (Devices for unmet medical needs - aspects
to consider).
b. Make a comprehensive analysis The evaluators should:
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4
page 27 of 65
•
Determine compliance with each of the Essential Requirements pertaining
to the clinical performance and clinical safety of the device. For
detailed information concerning specific Essential Requirements, see
Appendix A7 (Analysis of the clinical data - compliance to specific
Essential Requirements).
•
The evaluation includes - the adequacy of pre-clinical testing (e.g.
bench testing, animal testing) to verify safety - risks to patients,
users or other persons associated with the intended purpose of the
device - benefits to patients - confirmation that the device achieves
the performance(s) intended by the manufacturer, including all claims
made by the manufacturer - confirmation of usability, that the design
adequately reduces the risk of use error as far as possible, and that
the design is adequate for the intended users (lay, professional,
disabled or other users, if applicable) - adequacy of the information
materials supplied by the manufacturer, including if risk mitigation
measures are correctly addressed in the IFU (handling instructions,
description of risks, warnings, precautions, contraindications,
instructions for managing foreseeable unwanted situations)
•
Take into consideration all products covered by the clinical evaluation
and all aspects of their intended purpose. Any gaps in evidence need to
be identified, including in respect to information relevant to: -
understanding the interaction between the device and the body; - the
comprehensiveness of the available data, taking into account: - the
entire range of products/ models/ sizes/ settings covered by the
evaluation - the entire range of conditions of use and of the intended
purpose - the estimated number of patients exposed to the device - the
type and adequacy of patient monitoring - the number and severity of
adverse events - the adequacy of the estimation of associated risk for
each identified hazard - the severity and natural history of the
condition being diagnosed or treated - current standards of care,
including the availability and the benefit/risk profiles of other
devices and medical alternatives
•
Assess if there is consistency and alignment between the clinical
evaluation, the information materials supplied by the manufacturer, and
the risk management documentation for the device under evaluation; any
discrepancies should be identified in order to ensure that all the
hazards and other clinically relevant information have been identified
and analysed appropriately.
•
Assess if there is consistency between the documents mentioned above and
current knowledge/ the state of the art.
c. Determine if additional clinical investigations or other measures
are necessary The evaluators should identify additional clinical
investigations or other measures that are necessary in order to generate
any missing data and eliminate compliance issues. Data needed to address
the identified gaps should be determined so that conclusions can be
drawn with confidence in relation to conformity with the essential
requirements, including: - evaluation of the safety, performance and the
benefit/risk profile - compatibility with a high level of protection of
health and safety (that can be determined by considering current
knowledge/ the state of the art, with reference to standards and
available alternatives, risk minimisation, patient needs and
preferences) - the acceptability of any undesirable side-effects MEDDEV
2.7/1 revision 4
page 28 of 65
- the risk of use error and the adequacy of the IFU to the intended
users, - consistency between available information See Appendix A2 for
detailed information on when additional clinical investigations should
be carried out.
d. Determine PMCF needs In order to determine needs, the evaluators
should describe residual risks and any uncertainties or unanswered
questions. The evaluators should also include aspects such as rare
complications, uncertainties regarding medium- and long-term
performance, or safety under wide-spread use.
10.3. Where demonstration of conformity based on clinical data is not
deemed appropriate Where demonstration of conformity with Essential
Requirements based on clinical data is not deemed appropriate, adequate
justification for any such exclusion has to be given: •
The justification must be based on the output of the risk management
process. This should include an evaluation of background clinical data
identified from the literature, and an appraisal of their relevance to
the device under evaluation.
•
The device/body interaction, the clinical performances intended and the
claims of the manufacturer have to be specifically considered.
•
Adequacy of demonstration of conformity with the Essential Requirements
based on performance evaluation, bench testing and pre-clinical
evaluation in the absence of clinical data has to be duly substantiated.
•
A clinical evaluation is still required and the above information and
evidence-based justification should be presented in the clinical
evaluation report.
11. The clinical evaluation report (CER, Stage 4) A clinical evaluation
report shall be compiled to document the clinical evaluation and its
output. The clinical evaluation report should contain sufficient
information to be read and understood by an independent party (e.g.
regulatory authority or notified body). Therefore, it should provide
sufficient detail for understanding the search criteria adopted by the
evaluators, data that are available, all assumptions made and all
conclusions reached. The contents of the clinical evaluation report
shall be cross-referenced to the relevant documents that support them.
It should be clear which statements are substantiated by which data, and
which reflect the conclusions or opinions of the evaluators. The report
should include references to literature-based data and the titles and
investigational codes (if relevant and available) of any clinical
investigation reports, with cross-references to the location in the
manufacturer's technical documentation. The amount of information may
differ according to the history of the device or technology. Where a new
device or technology has been developed, the report would need to
include an overview of the developmental process and the points in the
development cycle at which all clinical data have been generated.
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4
page 29 of 65
It is important that the report outlines the different stages of the
clinical evaluation: •
Stage 0, scope of the clinical evaluation: - explains the scope and
context of the evaluation, including which products/ models/ sizes/
settings are covered by the clinical evaluation report, the technology
on which the medical device is based, the conditions of use and the
intended purpose of the device; - documents any claims made about the
device's clinical performance or clinical safety.
•
Stage 1, identification of pertinent data: - explains the literature
search strategy; - presents the nature and extent of the clinical data
and relevant pre-clinical data that have been identified.
•
Stage 2, appraisal of pertinent data: - explains the criteria used by
the evaluators for appraising data sets; - summarises the pertinent data
sets (methods, results, conclusions of the authors); - evaluates their
methodological quality, scientific validity, the relevance for the
evaluation, the weighting attributed to the evidence, and any
limitations; - presents justifications for rejecting certain data or
documents.
•
Stage 3, analysis of the clinical data: - explains if and how the
referenced information, such as confirmation of compliance with clinical
data requirement from applicable harmonised standards and the clinical
data, constitute sufficient clinical evidence for demonstration of the
clinical performance and clinical safety of the device under
evaluation; - explains whether there are adequate data for all aspects
of the intended purpose and for all products/ models/ sizes/ settings
covered by the clinical evaluation. - describes the benefits and risks
of the device (their nature, probability, extent, duration and
frequency); - explains the acceptability of the benefit/risk profile
according to current knowledge/ the state of the art in the medical
fields concerned, with reference to applicable standards and guidance
documents, available medical alternatives, and the analysis and
conclusions of the evaluators on fulfilment of all Essential
Requirements pertaining to clinical properties of the device (MDD ER1,
ER3, ER6; AIMDD ER1, ER2, ER5); - analyses if there is consistency
between the clinical data, the information materials supplied by the
manufacturer, the risk management documentation for the device under
evaluation; - whether there is consistency between these documents and
the current knowledge/ the state of the art; - identifies any gaps and
discrepancies; - identifies residual risks and uncertainties or
unanswered questions (such as rare complications, uncertainties
regarding medium- and long term performance, safety under wide-spread
use) that should be further evaluated during PMS, including in PMCF
studies.
The evaluators should check the clinical evaluation report, provide
verification that it includes an accurate statement of their analysis
and opinions, and sign the report. They should provide their CV and
their declaration of interests to the manufacturer. The clinical
evaluation report should be dated and version controlled. A suggested
format for the clinical evaluation report is located at Appendix A9
(Clinical evaluation report - proposed table of contents, examples of
contents). Suggestions for aspects that should be checked for the
release of a clinical evaluation report are summarised in Appendix A10
(Proposed checklist for the release of the clinical evaluation report).

Information on declaration of interests can be found in Appendix A11
(Information on declarations of interests).
12. The role of the notified body in the assessment of clinical
evaluation reports The notified body plays a key role in the assessment
and verification of clinical evaluation reports and supporting
documentation provided by medical device manufacturers to support
demonstration of conformity of a device with the Essential Requirements
of the relevant Directive. Detailed recommendations for notified bodies
are given in Appendix A12 (Activities of notified bodies). These
include: •
guidance for notified bodies on the assessment of clinical evaluation
reports provided by medical device manufacturers as part of technical
documentation (including design dossiers) and
•
guidance for notified body in development of their internal procedures
for assessment of clinical aspects relating to medical devices.
In addition, documents of the Notified Bodies Operations Group (NBOG)
should also be consulted. NBOG documents include best practice guides,
checklists and forms. Pursuant to section 6a of Annex I MDD and to
section 5a of Annex 1 AIMDD, the demonstration of conformity with the
Essential Requirements must include a clinical evaluation conducted in
accordance with Annex X of Directive 93/42/EEC or with Annex 7 AIMDD.
This is applicable for all classes of medical device. Where
demonstration of conformity with Essential Requirements based on
clinical data is not deemed appropriate this must be adequately
justified by the manufacturer and based on the output of the risk
management process. The device-body interaction, the intended purpose
and the claims of the manufacturer have to be specifically considered.
The adequacy of demonstration of conformity based on performance
evaluation, bench testing and pre-clinical evaluation in the absence of
clinical data must be duly substantiated. The notified body must review
the manufacturer's justification, the adequacy of data presented and
whether or not conformity is demonstrated. Nevertheless a clinical
evaluation is still required and the above information and an evidenced
justification should be presented as the clinical evaluation for the
device in question.
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4

Appendices A1. Demonstration of equivalence Pursuant to Annex X of
Directive MDD and Annex 7 AIMDD, the evaluation of clinical data (i.e.
the clinical evaluation), where appropriate taking account of any
relevant harmonised standards, must follow a defined and
methodologically sound procedure based on: 1. either a critical
evaluation of the relevant scientific literature currently available
relating to the safety, performance, design characteristics and intended
purpose of the device, where: - there is demonstration of equivalence of
the device to the device to which the data relates, and - the data
adequately demonstrate compliance with the relevant Essential
Requirements. 2. or a critical evaluation of the results of all clinical
investigations made. 3. or a critical evaluation of the combined
clinical data provided from 1 and 2. Clinical, technical and biological
characteristics shall be taken into consideration for the demonstration
of equivalence: •
Clinical: - used for the same clinical condition (including when
applicable similar severity and stage of disease, same medical
indication), and - used for the same intended purpose, and - used at the
same site in the body, and - used in a similar population (this may
relate to age, gender, anatomy, physiology, possibly other aspects),
and - not foreseen to deliver significantly different performances (in
the relevant critical performances such as the expected clinical effect,
the specific intended purpose, the duration of use, etc.).
•
Technical: - be of similar design, and - used under the same conditions
of use, and - have similar specifications and properties (e.g.
physicochemical properties such as type and intensity of energy, tensile
strength, viscosity, surface characteristics, wavelength, surface
texture, porosity, particle size, nanotechnology, specific mass, atomic
inclusions such as nitrocarburising, oxidability), and - use similar
deployment methods (if relevant), and - have similar principles of
operation and critical performance requirements.
•
Biological: Use the same materials or substances in contact with the
same human tissues or body fluids. Exceptions can be foreseen for
devices in contact with intact skin and minor components of devices; in
these cases risk analysis results may allow the use of similar materials
taking into account the role and nature of the similar material.
Different aspects of equivalence and compliance to different Essential
Requirements can be affected by materials. Evaluators should consider
biological safety (e.g. in compliance to ISO 10993) as well as other
aspects necessary for a comprehensive demonstration of equivalence. A
justification explaining the situation should be provided for any
difference.
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4
page 32 of 65
For assuming equivalence, •
equivalence can only be based on a single device14;
•
all three characteristics (clinical, technical, biological) need to be
fulfilled;
•
similar means that no clinically significant difference in the
performance and safety of the device would be triggered by the
differences between the device under evaluation and the device presumed
to be equivalent;
•
the differences between the device under evaluation and the device
presumed to be equivalent need to be identified, fully disclosed, and
evaluated; explanations should be given why the differences are not
expected to significantly affect the clinical performance and clinical
safety of the device under evaluation;
•
the manufacturer should investigate if the medical device presumed to be
equivalent has been manufactured via a special treatment (e.g. a surface
modification, a process that modifies material characteristics); if this
is the case, the treatment could cause differences in respect to
technical and biological characteristics; this should be taken into
account for the demonstration of equivalence and documented in the CER;
•
if measurements are possible, clinically relevant specifications and
properties should be measured both in the device under evaluation and
the device presumed to be equivalent, and presented in comparative
tabulations;
•
comparative drawings or pictures should be included in order to compare
shapes and sizes of elements that are in contact with the body;
•
the manufacturer is expected to: - include the supporting non-clinical
information (e.g. pre-clinical study reports) in the technical
documentation of the device, and - in the clinical evaluation report,
summarise the information and cite its location in the technical
documentation;
•
for the evaluation of the technical characteristics, devices that
achieve the same therapeutic result by different means cannot be
considered equivalent;
•
for the evaluation of the biological characteristics: - when a detailed
chemical characterisation of materials in contact with the body is
needed, ISO 10993-18 Annex C can be used to show toxicological
equivalence but this is just a part of the evaluation of the biological
criteria; - sourcing and manufacturing procedures may adversely affect
impurity profiles; analytical methods chosen to characterise medical
devices should appropriately take into consideration knowledge
concerning expected impurity profiles (tests may have to be repeated
when production methods or sourcing are changed); - it may be necessary
to show from histopathological studies that the same host response is
achieved in vivo in the intended application and the intended duration
of contact; - for animal tests, differences between species may limit
the predictive value of the test; the choice of the test and its
predictive value should be justified; - abrasion, if relevant, and host
response to particles may also need to be considered.
•
14
the only clinical data that are considered as relevant are the data
obtained when the equivalent device is a CE-marked medical device used
in accordance with its intended purpose as documented in the IFU.
Evaluators may wish to refer to several devices that are equivalent. In
such a situation, equivalence of every single device to the device under
evaluation should be fully investigated, demonstrated, and described in
the clinical evaluation report.
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4
page 33 of 65
Note: Exceptions can be considered. When the equivalent device is not a
CE-marked device, information concerning the regulatory status of the
equivalent device and a justification for the use of its data should be
included in the clinical evaluation report. The justification should
explain if the clinical data is transferrable to the European
population, and an analysis of any gaps to good clinical practices (such
as ISO 14155) and relevant harmonised standards.
A2. When should additional clinical investigations be carried out? a.
How should manufacturers and evaluators decide if there is sufficient
clinical evidence? When clinical data are required in order to draw
conclusions as to the conformity of a device to the Essential
Requirements, the data need to be in line with current knowledge/ the
state of the art, be scientifically sound, cover all aspects of the
intended purpose, and all products/ models/ sizes/ settings foreseen by
the manufacturer. If gaps are present that cannot be addressed by other
means, clinical investigations should be planned and carried out. b.
Considerations Implants and high-risk devices, those based on
technologies where there is little or no experience, and those that
extend the intended purpose of an existing technology (i.e. a new
clinical use) are most likely to require clinical investigation data.
For compliance with Annex X section 1.1.a MDD and Annex 7 AIMDD,
clinical investigations with the device under evaluation are required
for implantable and class III devices unless it can be duly justified to
rely on existing clinical data alone. The need for clinical
investigations depends on the ability of the existing data to adequately
address the benefit/risk profile, claims, and side-effects in order to
comply with the applicable Essential Requirements. Clinical
investigations may therefore also be required for other devices,
including for devices in class I and class IIa, and for class IIb
devices that are not implantable. When deciding if additional clinical
investigations need to be carried out, the manufacturer should perform a
detailed gap analysis. The gap analysis should determine whether the
existing data are sufficient to verify that the device is in conformity
with all the Essential Requirements pertaining to clinical performance
and clinical safety. Special attention should be given to aspects such
as: - new design features, including new materials, - new intended
purposes, including new medical indications, new target populations
(age, gender, etc.), - new claims the manufacturer intends to use, - new
types of users (e.g. lay persons), - seriousness of direct and/or
indirect risks, - contact with mucosal membranes or invasiveness, -
increasing duration of use or numbers of re-applications, -
incorporation of medicinal substances, - use of animal tissues (other
than in contact with intact skin),
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4
page 34 of 65
- issues raised when medical alternatives with lower risks or more
extensive benefits to patients are available or have become newly
available15, - issues raised when new risks are recognised (including
due to progress in medicine, science and technology) - whether the data
of concern are amenable to evaluation through a clinical
investigation, - etc. Data on the safety and performance of other
devices and alternative therapies, including benchmark devices and
equivalent devices, should be used to define the state of the art or
identify hazards due to substances and technologies. This will allow the
clinical data requirements to be established more precisely in relation
to the intended purpose of a device. Precision in this analysis and the
choice of selected medical indications and target populations may reduce
the amount of clinical data needed from additional clinical
investigations.
A3. Device description - typical contents The description should be
detailed enough to allow for a valid evaluation of the state of
compliance with Essential Requirements, the retrieval of meaningful
literature data and, if applicable, the assessment of equivalence to
other devices described in the scientific literature: •
name, models, sizes, components of the device, including software and
accessories
•
device group to which the device belongs (e.g. biological artificial
aortic valve)
•
whether the device is being developed/ undergoing initial CE-marking/ is
CE-marked

15
a concise physical and chemical description the technical
specifications, mechanical characteristics sterility radioactivity
See Appendix A7.2 (Conformity assessment with requirement on acceptable
benefit/risk profile)
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4
page 35 of 65
- how the device achieves its intended purpose - principles of
operation - materials used in the device with focus on materials coming
in contact (directly or indirectly) with the patient/ user, description
of body parts concerned - whether it incorporates a medicinal substance
(already on the market or new), animal tissues, or blood components, the
purpose of the component - other aspects •
whether the device is intended to cover medical needs that are otherwise
unmet/ if there are medical alternatives to the device / if the device
is equivalent to an existing device, with a description of the situation
and any new features
•
if the device is intended to enter the market based on equivalence: -
name, models, sizes, settings components of the device presumed to be
equivalent, including software and accessories - whether equivalence has
already been demonstrated
•
Intended performance, including the technical performance of the device
intended by the manufacturer, the intended clinical benefits, claims
regarding clinical performance and clinical safety that the manufacturer
intends to use
•
For devices based on predecessor devices: Name, models, sizes of the
predecessor device, whether the predecessor device is still on the
market, description of the modifications, date of the modifications.
•
The current version number or date of the information materials supplied
by the manufacturer (label, IFU, available promotional materials and
accompanying documents possibly foreseen by the manufacturer).
A4. Sources of literature There are different sources of clinical
literature that can be searched for clinical evaluation. A comprehensive
search strategy is required, normally involving multiple databases. The
search strategy should be documented and justified. Important sources
include the following: •
Scientific literature databases - MEDLINE or Pubmed can provide a good
starting point for a search. However, with possibly incomplete coverage
of European Journals and reduced search features, comprehensiveness may
not necessarily be guaranteed. - Additional databases may need to be
used to ensure adequate coverage of devices and therapies in use in
Europe, to identify relevant clinical trials and publications of user
experience16, and to facilitate searches by device name and manufacturer
(e.g. EMBASE/Excerpta Medica, the Cochrane CENTRAL trials register,
etc.). - Information coverage and search features available in
scientific databases can change with time. Criteria for selecting
adequate databases therefore need to be defined and reevaluated on a
regular basis.
•
16
Internet searches
Studies yielding negative results or user experience (such as
publications about risks that are based on a case or a case series) may
not qualify for publication in high impact medical journals. Low impact
journals available to European users and other sources may therefore
need to be searched.
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4
page 36 of 65
Searches provide important data, examples include information on: -
harmonised standards and other standards applicable to the device in
question and containing information on clinical performance and clinical
safety. - Field safety corrective actions for the equivalent and/or
other devices. These can be found on manufacturer's web sites, internet
sites of European Competent authorities, the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA), possibly other sites. - Implant registry
reports. - Documents available in systematic review databases (e.g. the
Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Prospero international
prospective register of systematic reviews). - Expert documents produced
by professional medical associations that are important for assessment
of current knowledge/ the state of the art, including clinical practice
guidelines and consensus statements. - Meta-analyses and reviews of
health technology assessment (HTA) institutes and networks. -
Identification of studies via the WHO International Clinical Trials
Registry Platform (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov. •
Non-published data Non published data are important for many devices and
retrieval of such data should be considered, including for monitoring of
any changes, e.g. - The label and IFU of the equivalent device (if
equivalence is claimed by the manufacturer) and/or of benchmark devices
and other devices. - Data provided to manufacturers from implant
registries. - Data presented at congresses.
•
Citations referenced in scientific literature can be important and
should be screened. Literature found to be relevant is likely to cite
other literature that is of direct interest to the manufacturer.
Additionally, it may be necessary to retrieve some of the referenced
literature in order to appraise the scientific quality of a document.
A5. Literature search and literature review protocol, key elements The
output of the literature search and literature review are: •
Literature on the device in question and the equivalent device. Note: If
the manufacturer holds own clinical data for the device in question
(e.g. own premarket clinical investigations, PMCF Studies, other PMS
data), the literature is considered together with those data for
consistent appraisal and overall analysis.
•
A review of the current knowledge/ the state of the art needed for the
proper conduct of the appraisal and analysis of the clinical data of the
device under evaluation and the equivalent device (i.e. applicable
standards and guidance documents, information on the medical conditions
that are relevant to the clinical evaluation, therapeutic/ management/
diagnostic options available for the intended patient population, etc.).
The literature collected may relate directly to the device in question
(e.g. publications of clinical investigations of the device in question
that have been performed by third parties, its side effects or
complications, incidence reports) and/or to equivalent device, benchmark
devices, other devices and medical alternatives available to the
intended patient population.
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4
page 37 of 65
The literature search and literature review protocol should address the
background to and the objective of the review, specifying the literature
review questions and the methods for identification, selection,
collection and appraisal of the relevant publications needed to address
them. It should include the literature search methodology (literature
search protocol). The selection of literature should be objective and
justified, i.e. include all relevant data, both favourable and
unfavourable. With respect to the clinical evaluation, it is important
that the clinical evaluators are able to assess the degree to which the
selected papers reflect the intended application/ use of the device.
Objective, non-biased, systematic search and review methods should be
used. Examples are: - PICO (patient characteristics, type of
intervention17, control, and outcome queries) - Cochrane Handbook for
Systematic Reviews of Interventions - PRISMA (The Preferred Reporting
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) Statement - MOOSE
Proposal (Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) The
protocol should specify the elements described below, addressing the
background, objective, and methods for identification, selection, and
collection of the relevant publications to address the literature review
questions.
A5.1. Background to the literature search and the literature review This
section documents the importance of and rationale for the literature
review and includes, but is not limited to: - Device name/model -
Importance of literature review to risk management process. The
literature review will provide data on current interventions18 for the
intended patient population (state of the art) in order to give input to
the assessments of acceptable benefit/risk profiles, what is currently
considered as providing a high level of protection of health and safety
and what are considered acceptable side-effects. - Previous literature
reviews - Importance of review to risk management process - Previous
literature searches conducted by the manufacturer - If including
equivalent or benchmark devices, name and model of the devices. - The
CER will need to establish equivalence to the device under evaluation or
the relevance of benchmark devices to the clinical evaluation.
A5.2. Objective This section documents the research question(s), which
should be consistent with the scope of the clinical evaluation and
carefully constructed using a process (e.g. PICO):
17
The term Intervention includes therapies, diagnostic measures, measures
for the management of diseases or medical conditions.
18
Includes therapies, diagnostic measures, measures for the management of
diseases or medical conditions.
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4
page 38 of 65
-
Population(s)/disease(s) or condition(s) Intervention(s) Comparator
group(s)/control(s) Outcome(s)/endpoint(s)
The inputs for the review question(s) (e.g. PICO) are the device
description and the intended performance of the device including any
claims on clinical performance and clinical safety which the
manufacturer wants to use. Also information from the risk management
process is needed as an input.
A5.3. Methods The methods section of the protocol documents the plans
for literature search, study selection, data collection, and analysis
methods. It defines the literature search strategy and the
inclusion/exclusion criteria for the documents found. The protocol
should include: •
the literature search methodology The purpose of a literature search
protocol is to plan the search before execution. It should be developed
and executed by persons with expertise in information retrieval, having
due regard to the scope of the clinical evaluation set out by the
manufacturer. The involvement of information retrieval experts will help
to optimize literature retrieval to identify all relevant published
literature. The importance of a literature search protocol is for
critical appraisal of the methods. The search strategy should be based
on carefully constructed review questions.
•
the sources of data that will be used and a justification for their
choice (see Appendix A4, Sources of literature)
•
the extent of any searches of scientific literature databases (the
database search strategy);
•
attempts to identify all published literature
•
which electronic databases are to be searched, with justification
•
the extent of any Internet searching and searching non-published
information, including the search strategy and justification
•
exact search terms and any limits
•
limits for start and end dates of each search
•
the selection/criteria (such as inclusion/exclusion criteria) to be
applied to published literature and justification for their choice
•
strategies for addressing the potential for duplication of data across
multiple publications;
•
strategies for avoiding retrieving publications of data generated and
already held by the manufacturer
•
the data collection plan that defines data management practices to
ensure data integrity during extraction (e.g. quality control/second
review of extracted data by additional reviewer)
•
the appraisal plan, which defines the methods for appraising each
publication, including the relevance of the data to the intended
clinical use and the methodological quality of the data
•
the analysis plan, which defines the methods for analysing the data
including data processing and transformation
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4
page 39 of 65
Any deviations from the literature search protocol should be noted in
the literature search report.
A6. Appraisal of clinical data - examples of studies that lack
scientific validity for demonstration of adequate clinical performance
and/or clinical safety a. Lack of information on elementary aspects:
This includes reports and publications that omit disclosure of - the
methods used - the identity of products used - numbers of patients
exposed - what the clinical outcomes were - all the results the clinical
study or investigation planned to investigate - undesirable side-effects
that have been observed - confidence intervals/ calculation of
statistical significance - if there are intent-to-treat and per protocol
populations: definitions and results for the two populations b. Numbers
too small for statistical significance Includes publications and reports
with inconclusive preliminary data, inconclusive data from feasibility
studies, anecdotal experience, hypothesis papers and unsubstantiated
opinions. c. Improper statistical methods This includes - results
obtained after multiple subgroup testing, when no corrections have been
applied for multiple comparisons. - calculations and tests based on a
certain type of distribution of data (e.g. Gaussian distribution with
its calculations of mean values, standard deviations, confidence
intervals, t-tests, others tests), while the type of distribution is not
tested, the type of distribution is not plausible, or the data have not
been transformed. Data such as survival curves, e.g. implant survival,
patient survival, symptom-free survival, are generally unlikely to
follow a Gaussian distribution. d. Lack of adequate controls In the
following situations, bias or confounding are probable in single
arm-studies and in other studies that do not include appropriate
controls: - when results are based on subjective endpoint assessments
(e.g. pain assessment). - when the endpoints or symptoms assessed are
subject to natural fluctuations (e.g. regression to the mean when
observing patients with chronic diseases and fluctuating symptoms, when
natural improvement occurs, when the natural course of the disease in a
patient is not clearly predictable). - when effectiveness studies are
conducted with subjects that are likely to take or are foreseen to
receive effective co-interventions (including over-the-counter
medication and other therapies). - when there may be other influencing
factors (e.g. outcomes that are affected by variability of the patient
population, of the disease, of user skills, of infrastructure available
for planning/ intervention/ aftercare, use of prophylactic medication,
other factors).
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4
page 40 of 65
- when there are significant differences between the results of existing
publications, pointing to variable and ill controlled influencing
factors. In the situations described above, it is generally not adequate
to draw conclusions based on direct comparisons with external or
historic data (such as drawing conclusions by comparing data from a
clinical investigation with device registry data or with data from
published literature). Different study designs may allow direct
comparisons and conclusions to be drawn in these situations, such as
randomised controlled design, cross-over design, or split-body design.
e. Improper collection of mortality and serious adverse events data
Demonstration of adequate benefits and safety is sometimes based on
mortality data or occurrence of other serious outcomes that limit a
subject's ability to live in his home and be available for follow-up
contacts. In this type of study, - consent of the subjects for
contacting reference persons/ institutions for retrieval of medical
information should be obtained during recruitment; when subjects can no
longer be found, outcomes should be investigated with the reference
persons/ institutions; - the consequences of missing data on the results
should be analysed (e.g. with a sensitivity analysis); alternatively,
when patients can no longer be found and their outcomes cannot be
identified, they should be considered to meet the SAE endpoint under
investigation (e.g. the mortality endpoint of a study). In mortality
studies (and other studies addressing serious outcomes) procedures for
investigating serious patient outcomes, numbers of subjects lost to
follow-up, reasons why subjects leave the study, and the results of
sensitivity analysis should be fully disclosed in reports and
publications. f. Misinterpretation by the authors Includes conclusions
that are not in line with the results section of the report or
publication, such as - reports and publications not correctly addressing
lack of statistical significance/ confidence intervals that encompass
the null hypothesis. - effects too small for clinical relevance. g.
Illegal activities Includes clinical investigations not conducted in
compliance with local regulations. Clinical investigations are generally
expected to be designed, conducted and reported in accordance with EN
ISO 14155 or to a comparable standard, and in compliance with local
regulations and the Declaration of Helsinki.
A7. Analysis of the clinical data - compliance to specific Essential
Requirements While this appendix describes the needs for the clinical
evaluation (MDD ER1, ER3, ER6; AIMDD ER1, ER2, ER5), there may be
additional essential requirement(s) that need support of sufficient
clinical evidence for the conformity assessment.
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4
page 41 of 65
A7.1. Conformity assessment with requirement on safety (MDD ER1 / AIMDD
ER1) The information materials supplied by the manufacturer (including
label, IFU, available promotional materials including accompanying
documents possibly foreseen by the manufacturer), should be reviewed to
ensure they are consistent with the relevant clinical data appraised in
stage 2 and that all the hazards, information on risk mitigation and
other clinically relevant information have been identified
appropriately. Input from the risk management and the use of standards:
-
-
Risk management documents should determine if all identified hazards are
fully covered by harmonised standards or other relevant standards or if
there are gaps needed to be covered by clinical data. Risk management
documents should determine if all identified risks relating to patient
treatment, method of operation of the device or risks relating to
usability have been minimised or if there are question regarding
clinical risks that need to be solved. Harmonised standards are
generally expected to be applied in full in order to confer a
presumption of conformity. If technical developments provide a higher
level of safety than current harmonised standards, then the higher level
of safety should be prioritised in order to meet the Essential
Requirements on reducing the risks as far as possible, that risks must
be compatible with a high level of protection of health and safety, and
that side effects must be acceptable (MDD ER2 and ER3 and ER6; AIMDD ER1
and ER5).
Examples: -
Electrical hazards should be covered by compliance to EN 60601-1 and
applicable collateral standards regarding medical electrical equipment,
so that the device will not compromise the safety and health of patients
or users. Under these circumstances, residual risks regarding electrical
hazards are acceptable and additional clinical data are not needed
unless negative issues are detected during PMS activities.
-
Harmonised standards on usability (EN 62366 and if applicable EN
60601-1-6) are expected to be applied to ensure that usability aspects
are taken into consideration during the device development. However,
they do not give guidance on a detailed level of design, while usability
aspects are known to cause or contribute to a large portion of
incidents. Therefore, clinical data may be needed to prove that the risk
of use error, due to the ergonomic features of the device and the
environment in which the device is intended to be used, has been reduced
as far as possible.
A7.2. Conformity assessment (MDD ER1 / AIMDD ER1)
with
requirement
on
acceptable
benefit/risk
profile
It is expected, •
that the clinical evaluation demonstrates that any risks which may be
associated with the intended purpose are minimised and acceptable when
weighed against the benefits to the patient and are compatible with a
high level of protection of health and safety; and
•
that the IFU correctly describe the intended purpose of the device as
supported by sufficient clinical evidence; and
•
that the IFU contain correct information to reduce the risk of use
error, information on residual risks and their management as supported
by sufficient clinical evidence (e.g.
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4
page 42 of 65
handling instructions, description of risks, warnings, precautions,
contraindications, instructions for managing foreseeable unwanted
situations).
a. Evaluation of the description of the intended purpose of the device
The information materials supplied by the manufacturer (including label,
IFU, available promotional materials including accompanying documents
possibly foreseen by the manufacturer) should be reviewed. The
evaluators should evaluate if the description provided by the
manufacturer correctly identifies those medical conditions and target
groups for which conformity with the relevant Essential Requirements has
been demonstrated through sufficient clinical evidence. When reading the
IFU, there should be no uncertainty for users as to when a given medical
condition or medical indication or target population is covered by the
CE marking or when it falls entirely under the user's own
responsibility (off label use).
b. Evaluation of the device's benefits to the patient Positive impacts
of a device on the health of an individual should be meaningful
(relevant for the patient) and measurable. The nature, extent,
probability and duration of benefits should be considered. Benefits may
include: •
positive impact on clinical outcome (such as reduced probability of
adverse outcomes, e.g. mortality, morbidity; or improvement of impaired
body function),
•
the patient's quality of life (significant improvements, including by
simplifying care or improving the clinical management of patients,
improving body functions, providing relief from symptoms),
•
outcomes related to diagnosis (such as allowing a correct diagnosis to
be made, provide earlier diagnosis of diseases or specifics of diseases,
or identify patients more likely to respond to a given therapy),
•
positive impact from diagnostic devices on clinical outcomes, or
•
public health impact (such as to the ability of a diagnostic medical
device to identify a specific disease and therefore prevent its spread,
to identify phases, stages, location, severity or variants of disease,
predict future disease onset).
c. Quantification of benefit(s) to the patients Defining specified
endpoints is indispensable for setting up clinical investigations and
properly performing the identification, appraisal, and analysis of the
clinical data. •
Benefit(s) are often evaluated along a scale or according to specific
endpoints or criteria (types of benefits), or by evaluating whether a
pre-identified health threshold was achieved. The change in subjects'
condition or clinical management as measured on that scale, or as
determined by an improvement or worsening of the endpoint, determines
the magnitude of the benefit(s) in subjects. Variation in the magnitude
of the benefit across a population may also be considered.
•
The clinical relevance of these changes should be discussed and
justified.
•
Ideally, these parameters should be directly clinically relevant.
•
In certain cases benefits can be assumed when validated surrogate
endpoints are met (such as obtaining certain results with laboratory
tests or measurements of anatomical or physiological properties).
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4
page 43 of 65
•
Based on the current state of medical knowledge, the evaluators shall
justify and document the clinical relevance of endpoints used for the
clinical evaluation of a device and demonstrate the validity of all
surrogate endpoints (if surrogate endpoints have been used).
The probability of the patient experiencing one or more benefit(s) is
another important aspect of evaluating benefits and the clinical
performance of a device. •
Based on the clinical data provided and on a sound statistical approach,
a reasonable prediction of the proportion of "responders" out of the
target group or subgroups should be made.
•
The data may show that a benefit may be experienced only by a small
proportion of patients in the target population, or, on the other hand,
that a benefit may occur frequently in patients throughout the target
population. It is also possible that the data will show that different
patient subgroups are likely to experience different benefits or
different levels of the same benefit.
•
If the subgroups can be identified, the device may be indicated for
those subgroups only.
•
In some cases, however, the subgroups may not be identifiable. Magnitude
and probability of clinical benefits will have to be put together when
weighing benefits against risks.
•
A large benefit experienced by a small proportion of subjects may raise
different considerations than does a small benefit experienced by a
large proportion of subjects. For example, a large benefit, even if
experienced by a small population, may be significant enough to outweigh
risks, whereas a small benefit may not, unless experienced by a large
population of subjects.
The duration of effect(s) (i.e. how long the benefit can be expected to
last for the patient, if applicable to the device) •
The duration should be characterised (for example as a statistical
distribution) on the basis of sound clinical data and appropriate
statistical approaches.
•
PMCF will be decisive to refine and corroborate reasonable predictions
over time.
•
The mode of action may play an important role: Some treatments are
curative, whereas, some may need to be repeated frequently over the
patient's lifetime.
•
To the extent that it is known, the duration of a treatment's effect may
directly influence how its benefit is defined. Treatments that must be
repeated over time may introduce greater risk, or the benefit
experienced may diminish each time the treatment is repeated.
•
The evaluation of the duration of effect should take into consideration
current knowledge/ the state of the art and available alternatives.
d. Evaluation of the clinical risks of devices The risk management
documents are expected to identify the risks associated with the device
and how such risks have been addressed. The clinical evaluation is
expected to address the significance of any risks that remain after
design risk mitigation strategies have been employed by the
manufacturer. PMS reports are compiled by the manufacturer and often
include details of the device's regulatory status (countries in which
the device is marketed and date of commencement of supply), regulatory
actions undertaken during the reporting period (e.g. recalls,
notifications), a tabulation of incidents (particularly serious adverse
events/ incidents, including deaths, stratified into whether the
manufacturer considers them to be device-related or not) and estimates
of the incidence of incidents.
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4
page 44 of 65
Post-marketing data about incidents are generally more meaningful when
related to usage but caution is needed. The extent of user reporting in
the medical devices vigilance system may vary considerably between
countries, users, and type of incident. Considerable under-reporting by
users is expected. However, the analyses of data within these reports
may, for some devices, provide reasonable assurance of both clinical
safety and performance. It may be helpful to provide a table summarising
device-related incidents, paying particular attention to serious adverse
events/ incidents, with comments on whether observed devicerelated
incidents are predictable on the basis of the mode of action of the
device. To demonstrate the extent of the probable risk(s)/ harm(s), the
following factors - individually and in the aggregate - should be
addressed: •
Nature severity, number and rates of harmful events associated with the
use of the device: - Device-related serious adverse events/ incidents:
Those events that may have been or were attributed to the use of the
device and produce an injury or illness that is lifethreatening, results
in permanent impairment or damage to the body, or requires medical or
surgical intervention to prevent permanent harm to the body. -
Device-related non-serious/ non-reportable harmful events: Those events
that may have been or were attributed to the use of the device and that
do not meet the criteria for classification as a device-related serious
adverse events/ incidents. - Procedure-related incidents: Harm to the
patient that results from use of the device but is not caused by the
device itself. For example, anaesthetic-related complications associated
with the implantation of a device.
•
Probability of a harmful event: The proportion of the intended
population that would be expected to experience a harmful event; whether
an event occurs once or repeatedly may be factored into the measurement
of probability.
•
Duration of harmful events (i.e., how long the adverse consequences
last): Some devices can cause temporary, minor harm; some devices can
cause repeated but reversible harm; and other devices can cause
permanent, debilitating injury. The severity of the harm should be
considered along with its duration.
•
Risk from false-positive or false-negative results for diagnostic
medical devices : - if a diagnostic device gives a false-positive
result, the patient might, for example, receive an unnecessary treatment
and incur all the risks that accompany that treatment, or might be
incorrectly diagnosed with a serious disease; - if a diagnostic device
gives a false-negative result, the patient might not receive an
effective treatment (thereby missing out on the benefits that treatment
would confer), or might not be diagnosed with the correct disease or
condition; - other risks associated with false-positives and
false-negatives.
•
It is also important to look at the totality of the harmful events
associated with the device. The number of different types of harmful
events that can potentially result from using the device and the
severity of their aggregate effect has to be considered. When multiple
harmful events occur at once, they have a greater aggregate effect.
•
Comment specifically on any clinical data that identifies hazards not
previously considered in the risk management documentation, outlining
any additional mitigation required (e.g. design modification, amendment
of information materials supplied by the manufacturer such as inclusion
of contraindications in the IFU).
e. Evaluation of acceptability of the benefit/risk profile •
Evaluate if the clinical data on benefits and risks are acceptable for
all medical conditions and target populations covered by the intended
purpose when compared with the current
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4
page 45 of 65
state of the art in the corresponding medical field and whether
limitations need to be considered for some populations and/or medical
conditions. •
The current knowledge/ state of the art therefore needs to be identified
and defined, possibly also relevant benchmark devices and medical
alternatives available to the target population. Typically,
documentation of the clinical background shall include the following
information: - clinical background - information on the clinical
condition(s) to be treated, managed, or diagnosed - prevalence of the
condition(s) - natural course of the condition(s) - other devices,
medical alternatives available to the target population, including
evidence of clinical performance and safety -
historical treatments
-
medical options available to the target population (including
conservative, surgical and medicinal)
-
existing devices, benchmark devices
•
Sufficient detail of the clinical background is needed so that the state
of the art can be accurately characterised in terms of clinical
performance, and clinical safety profile. The selection of clinical data
that characterises the state of the art should be objective and not
selective of data on the basis of being favourable for the device under
evaluation. Information should be provided on alternative approaches
that have been used or considered and their benefits and drawbacks.
Deficiencies in current therapies should be identified from a critical
and comprehensive review of relevant published literature. The
literature review should demonstrate if the device addresses a
significant gap in healthcare provision. Where there is no such clinical
need, the design solution needs to show an improved or at least
equivalent benefit/risk profile compared to existing products or
therapies.
•
If or when treatment comparability versus accepted therapy is not
available at the time of placing on the market, this should be clearly
described in the device IFU.
•
Even if a device cannot compete with an agreed first-line treatment or
the best in class, it may add to the portfolio of acceptable treatments,
as even a first-line treatment will likely have contraindications or
non-responders.
•
Devices, that might not be best-in-class, might provide sufficient
clinical evidence for an acceptable benefit/risk-profile for specific,
defined subgroups or even superior clinical performance under specific
conditions (e.g. emergency outdoor conditions).
•
The position within the treatment portfolio has to be specified properly
in the clinical evaluation report and other relevant documentation.
Example: A system for deep brain stimulation has a proven effectiveness
for the treatment of depression. However, the implantation of electrodes
in the brain is associated with major risks. Less invasive treatment
options are available to patients suffering from depression. Taking into
account the available treatment portfolio, the manufacturer has limited
the medical indication of the device to "therapy resistant
depression", which is reflected in the IFU and in other relevant
documentation.

A7.3. Conformity assessment (MDD ER3 / AIMDD ER2)
with
requirement
on
performance
The devices must achieve the performances intended by the manufacturer.
The ability of a medical device to achieve its intended purpose as
claimed by the manufacturer needs to be demonstrated, including any
direct or indirect medical effects on humans as well as the clinical
benefit on patients resulting from the technical or functional,
including diagnostic characteristics of a device, when used as intended
by the manufacturer. Clinical performance includes any claims about
clinical properties and safety of the device that the manufacturer
intends to use. It is expected: • •
that the devices achieve their intended performances during normal
conditions of use, and that the intended performances are supported by
sufficient clinical evidence.
Evaluation of clinical performance can vary widely between device
groups, especially between therapeutic and diagnostic devices. The
following list gives examples of performance data relevant particularly
to diagnostic devices: •
Reproducibility of independent acquisition of images (same patient, same
machine, different operator and interpreter).
•
Reproducibility of independent reporting of images (same patient, same
machine, same images, different interpreter/analyser).
•
Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the test for major clinical
indications; positive and negative predictive values according to
varying pre-test probabilities.
•
Comparisons of performance of new iterations of diagnostic software
against previous software versions.
•
Normal values by age and gender, covering all groups in which the
diagnostic system may be used.
A7.4. Conformity assessment with requirement on acceptability of
undesirable side-effects (MDD ER6 / AIMDD ER5) Any undesirable
side-effect must constitute an acceptable risk when weighed against the
performances intended. In order to evaluate the acceptability of the
side-effects of a device: •
there needs to be clinical data for the evaluation of the nature,
severity and frequency of potential undesirable side-effects;
•
the clinical data should contain an adequate number of observations
(e.g. from clinical investigations or PMS) to guarantee the scientific
validity of the conclusions relating to undesirable side-effects and the
performance of the device;
•
in order to evaluate if undesirable side-effects are acceptable,
consideration has to be given to the state of the art, including
properties of benchmark devices and medical alternatives that are
currently available to the patients, and reference to objective
performance criteria from applicable standards and guidance documents.
If there is lack of clinical data or an insufficient number of
observations, conformity with the requirement on acceptability of
undesirable side-effects is not fulfilled. Example:
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4
page 47 of 65
A reasonable probability (80%) of observing at least one event of an
undesirable side-effect when 15 subjects are studied requires a
side-effect with an actual probability of 10%. If only 15 patients have
been studied, from a statistical point of view, there could be serious
side-effects with an actual probability of 10% that have not had a
reasonable chance to be detected. The device would only be acceptable
(for any type and severity of undesirable side-effects), if that
magnitude is acceptable when weighted against the performance of the
device and the current state of the art. The table below shows
corresponding numbers for undesirable side-effects with an actual
probability of 10%, 5% and 1%. Case 1

The threshold proposed as acceptable for any new device will depend on
the severity and detectability of side effects concerned.
A8. Devices for unmet medical needs - aspects to consider Like all
medical devices, medical devices for unmet medical needs must fully
comply with the Essential Requirements in order to be CE-marked. The
evaluators should assess whether devices deliver clinical benefits to
patients for •
medical conditions that are life threatening, or cause permanent
impairment of a body function, and
•
for which current medical alternatives are insufficient or carry
significant risks.
Corresponding devices are referred to as "breakthrough products" in
this Appendix. a. Breakthrough products In exceptional cases, major
benefits may justify relatively high levels of uncertainty, and access
to the market may be granted on the basis of limited clinical evidence
such as •
experience available from compassionate use/ humanitarian exemption
programs, use of custom-made devices, results of feasibility studies;
•
limited long-term data.
In addition to general aspects described in this MEDDEV document, the
evaluators should fully disclose the situation and address the following
items in the clinical evaluation report: •
the exact intended purpose, including the medical indication (if
applicable to the device), the product was developed for and whether
residual risks and uncertainties or unanswered questions are considered
acceptable in this indication (often a niche indication);
•
explanations of why current medical alternatives are considered to be
insufficient or to carry significant risks;
•
explanations of the benefits delivered by the device under evaluation;
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4
page 48 of 65
•
whether the IFU clearly describe - the exact intended purpose (including
medical indications) and any limitations, - the limited clinical
experience, - uncertainties or unanswered questions about residual risks
and benefits to patients19;
•
the need to set up a stringent PMCF plan with information on - the type
and quality of data that needs to be generated in the post-market phase
in order to further evaluate the clinical performance and clinical
safety of the device; - how to generate data in a timely manner and
aspects thereof, including projections on the numbers of patients that
will be managed with the device per year; - in the following cases, the
manufacturer should aim at including all patients in PMCF studies: - a
device that carries significant risks (i.e. expected to cause serious
adverse events), or - a device for rare diseases.
•
the need to actively update the clinical evaluation report when new
significant information become available, and in accordance with Section
6.2.3 b of the present document.
In these exceptional cases, notified bodies should perform annual
assessments of the updated clinical evaluation reports and the results
of PMCF studies.
b. Subsequent products Devices that enter the market subsequent to a
therapeutic/ diagnostic breakthrough can not be judged by the same
criteria as listed above for breakthrough devices. When performing a
clinical evaluation for these devices, the following considerations
should be taken into account: •
when a device enters the market subsequent to a therapeutic/diagnostic
breakthrough, clinical evidence is likely to have evolved rapidly since
the first breakthrough device became available
•
with the evolving body of evidence, entering the market with large
uncertainty may no longer be legitimate
•
if PMCF data are required, PMCF Studies should also be foreseen for
devices that enter the market subsequent to a therapeutic/ therapeutic
breakthrough
A9. Clinical evaluation report - proposed table of contents, examples of
contents Examples of contents that are shown in the table are for
illustration. The contents of the clinical evaluation report will vary
according to the nature and history of the device under evaluation.
19
Example: "No serious long-term adverse effects have been reported to
date". This would be an inadequate description of limited experience and
of uncertainties as to residual risks.

A10. Proposed checklist for the release of the clinical evaluation
report The following aspects should be checked for the release of a
clinical evaluation report: •
Can the report be read and understood by a third party, does it provide
sufficient detail for understanding the data that are available, all
assumptions made and all conclusions reached?
•
If clinical data have been generated and are held by the manufacturer,
are all data mentioned and adequately summarised in the report?
•
If equivalence is claimed, - is demonstration of equivalence included in
the report? - does the report disclose all the differences between the
device under evaluation and the equivalent device? - does it explain why
the differences are not expected to affect the clinical performance and
clinical safety of the device?
•
If the product is already in the market in Europe or elsewhere, has the
latest PMS/ PMCF data been taken into consideration and has it been
summarised and referenced in the report?
•
In respect to current knowledge/ the state of the art, - has the report
been updated? - is current knowledge/ the state of the art summarised in
the report and is it adequately substantiated by literature? - does the
content of the report fully correspond to current knowledge/ the state
of the art? - does the report explain why the benefit/risk profile and
the undesirable side-effects are acceptable in relation to current
knowledge/ the state of the art?
•
If the report covers several models/ sizes/ settings and/or different
clinical situations, is there sufficient clinical evidence and are the
report's conclusions correct for - all the devices? - all its sizes,
models and settings? (including the smallest/ largest size, highest/
lowest dose, etc.) - every medical indication? (as described in the IFU/
not excluded with contraindications in the IFU) - the entire target
population? (from pre term infants to old age, for males and females,
etc., if not restricted in the IFU) - every form, stage and severity of
the medical condition, as applicable?

not excluded in the IFU) - all intended users? (including lay persons,
if not excluded in the IFU, and any unusual user group) - the whole
duration of product use, including the maximal number of repeated
exposure? (as allowed by the IFU) - if there are any discrepancies as to
the above, are they identified in the report's conclusions? •
Is conformity to each of the relevant Essential Requirements (AIMDD
ER1,2,5 / MDD ER1,3,6 ) clearly stated and are all discrepancies
identified in the report's conclusions?
•
Do the information materials supplied by the manufacturer correspond
with the contents of the report and are all discrepancies identified in
the report's conclusions?
•
Do the report's conclusions identify all residual risks and
uncertainties or unanswered questions that should be addressed with PMS/
PMCF studies?
•
Is the report dated?
•
Is the qualification of the evaluators included in the report and
correct?
•
Does the manufacturer hold a CV and declaration of interests of each of
the evaluators and are these up-to-date?
A11. Information on declarations of interests Declarations of interests
of the evaluators should be held by the manufacturer and cover relevant
financial interests outside the current work as an evaluator.
Declarations of interests should contain statements that clarify the
extent of the declaration. For example: -
the time span included (e.g. grants, sources of revenue or benefits paid
or promised to be paid over the 36 months prior to the evaluation)
-
whether financial interests of family members are included or not
(namely spouse or partner living in the same residence as the evaluator,
children and adults for whom the evaluators is legally responsible)
Typical contents: - employment by the manufacturer - participation as an
investigator in clinical studies of the device, or in pre-clinical
testing of the device - ownership/ shareholding possibly affected by the
outcome of the evaluation - grants sponsored by the manufacturer -
benefits such as travelling or hospitality (if beyond what is reasonably
necessary for the work as an employee or external evaluator) - interests
in connection with the manufacturing of the device or its constituents -
interests in connection with intellectual property, such as patents,
copyrights and royalties (whether pending, issued or licensed) possibly
affected by the outcome of the evaluation - other interests or sources
of revenues possibly affected by the result of the evaluation The
declaration of interests should be dated and signed by the evaluator and
the manufacturer.

A12. Activities of notified bodies A12.1. Notified body assessment of
clinical evaluation by conformity assessment route The notified body
assessment of clinical Evaluation reports and the supporting data
presented by manufacturers is required for all medical devices. The
timing and frequency of the notified body reviews will vary according to
the risk carried by the device, how well established the device is (see
Section 6.2.3) and the conformity assessment procedure that is applied.
This includes for medical devices in accordance with Directive
93/42/EEC: •
•
An audit as part of a quality system approval procedure (Annex II,
section 3): -
the notified body assesses the manufacturer's procedure for clinical
evaluation, PMS plan and PMCF plan and (if applicable) results of PMCF.
-
as part of the representative sampling of devices21; for review of their
technical documentation the notified body assesses the clinical
evaluation report presented for class IIa22 and IIb devices as presented
below for a design dossier.
A design dossier (Annex II, section 4) or type examination dossier
(Annex III) assessment: -
the notified body assesses the data presented in the clinical evaluation
report,
-
assesses the validity of the conclusions drawn by the manufacturer, and
-
the conformity of the device to relevant essential requirements.
For active implantable medical devices in accordance with Directive
90/385/EEC: •
A design dossier (Annex 2, section 4) or type examination dossier (Annex
3) assessment: -
the notified body assesses the data presented in the clinical evaluation
report,
-
assesses the validity of the clinical evaluation report and the
conclusions drawn by the manufacturer, and
-
the conformity of the device to relevant essential requirements.
The notified body should also have documented procedures to address the
review of updates to clinical evaluation reports during their scheduled
surveillance activities and at the time of changes to or extensions of
EC design-examination/EC type-examination certificates. The review
should take into account aspects described in Section 6.2.3. This arises
from the obligation placed on the manufacturer to actively update the
clinical evaluation with data obtained from PMS e.g. PMCF and ongoing
literature reviews/surveys. In addition, notified bodies should refer to
guidance, checklists and other documents available on the assessment of
clinical evaluations by notified bodies from the Notified Body
Operations Group (NBOG). These should be considered in addition to this
guidance. Any such checklists are intended only as an aide memoire for
assessment and should not replace the Clinical Evaluation Assessment
Report (CEAR) outlined below.
21
In accordance with NBOG BPG 2009-4
22
Alternatively Annex VII coupled with Annex IV, V or VI could apply
rather than Annex II.3
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4

A12.2. Examination of a design dossier (Annex II.4; Annex 2.4) or of a
type examination dossier (Annex III; Annex 3) The notified body examines
the clinical evaluation documentation submitted (relevant documentation
referenced in previous sections of this MEDDEV), assesses the
manufacturer's identification, appraisal and analysis of that data, and
validates the conclusions drawn by the manufacturer. In order to do so,
the notified body should possess enough knowledge and experience in
clinical evaluation as stated in previous sections of this document.
A12.2.1.
Decision-making by the notified body
In reviewing the evaluation of clinical data submitted by the
manufacturer, the notified body verifies and concludes whether or not
the manufacturer has adequately: -
supplied clinical evaluation documentation (as referenced in previous
sections);
-
followed relevant procedures (as addressed by previous sections);
-
described and verified the intended characteristics and performances
related to clinical aspects;
-
performed an appropriate risk analysis and estimated the undesirable
side-effects which are aligned with the clinical evaluation;
-
involved appropriate clinical expertise in the clinical evaluation and
in the compilation of the risk analysis to ensure risks and benefits
associated with real clinical use are adequately defined;
-
provided a solid justification as the basis for their estimations of
benefits, risks, undesirable side-effects, indications and
contraindications of the device in question;
-
justified the chosen route(s) of clinical data retrieval (according to
previous sections);
-
identified, appraised, analysed and assessed the clinical data
(according to previous sections) and demonstrated the relevance and any
limitations of the clinical data identified in demonstrating compliance
with particular requirements of the Directive or cited in particular
aspects of the risk analysis;
-
identified all clinical data, favourable and unfavourable, that is
relevant to the device and using an appropriately robust, reproducible
and systematic search strategy;
-
provided sufficient clinical evidence relating to the safety, including
benefits to the patients, the clinical performance intended by the
manufacturer (including any clinical claims for the device the
manufacturer intends to use), design characteristics and intended
purpose of the device, in order to demonstrate conformity with each of
the relevant essential requirements;
-
conducted and provided a critical evaluation of relevant scientific
literature and data relating to the safety, benefits, performance,
design characteristics and intended purpose of the device;
-
demonstrated the equivalence of the device under evaluation to the
device to which the data relates in all necessary areas, i.e. clinical,
technical, biological and that the data available adequately addresses
conformity to each of the relevant essential requirements (if a critical
evaluation of relevant scientific literature is provided as the only
source of clinical data);
-
designed appropriate clinical investigations, when necessary, to address
specific questions arising from the critical review of the scientific
literature and address each of the relevant essential requirements;
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4
page 58 of 65
-
provided specific justification if a specific clinical investigation was
not performed for class III or implantable devices;
-
provided evidence that clinical investigations presented are in
compliance with applicable regulatory and ethical requirements e.g.
scientific validity, ethics committee approval, competent authority
approval;
-
provided detail of the PMS plan in place for the particular device and
justified the appropriateness and adequacy of this plan;
-
clearly identified which areas in the clinical evaluation and related
data need to be further addressed and confirmed in the post-market
phase, with specific alignment to the PMCF;
-
justified the appropriateness of the planned PMCF;
-
justified and documented if PMCF is not planned as part of the PMS plan
for the device;
-
identified the sources of clinical data which will be gathered from the
manufacturer's PMS system and PMCF;
-
concluded that the contents of the IFU are supported by clinical
evidence (description of the intended purpose, handling instructions,
type and frequency of risks, warnings, precautions, contraindications,
others) and are in line with the risk analysis and clinical evaluation;
-
concluded on the basis of documented evidence: a. that the risks are
acceptable when weighed against the intended benefits and are compatible
with a high level of protection of health and safety, b. that the
intended clinical performances described by the manufacturer are
achieved by the device, and c. that any undesirable side-effect
constitutes an acceptable risk when weighed against the performances
intended.
The assessment carried out by the notified body will in addition
typically confirm the following aspects of the manufacturer's clinical
evaluation: -
appraisal to determine suitability and any limitations of the data
presented to address the essential requirements in particular relating
to the safety, and performance of the device as outlined in previous
sections;
-
the validity of any justification given;
-
characterisation and evidence-based proof of the clinical performance of
the device intended by the manufacturer and the expected benefits for
the defined patient group(s);
-
the application of all relevant harmonised standards or appropriate
justifications if not;
-
identified hazards to be addressed through analysis of clinical data as
described in Section 10;
-
the adequate estimation of the associated risks for each identified
hazard by: - characterising the severity of the hazard; - estimating and
characterising the probability of occurrence of harm, impairment of
health or loss of benefit of the treatment (documented and discussed
based on scientifically valid clinical data); - the adequate description
and estimation of the current state of the art in the corresponding
medical field; - a justifiable and reasoned basis for estimation of
risks and hazards.
Where a device incorporates, as an integral part, a substance which, if
used separately, may be considered to be a medicinal product, the
notified body is responsible for verifying the usefulness MEDDEV 2.7/1
revision 4
page 59 of 65
of the medicinal substance as part of the device prior to the submission
of an application for scientific opinion from a medicines authority. For
drug-device combination products and products incorporating stable human
blood derivatives, where a scientific opinion from a medicinal competent
authority or from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has been sought,
the notified body should consider any comments or considerations raised
in the medicinal clinical assessment when making its final decision on
the device. In the case of devices with a human blood derivative the
notified body may not deliver a positive decision to issue a certificate
if the EMA's scientific opinion is unfavourable.
A12.2.2.
The report of the notified body
The notified body should write a Clinical Evaluation Assessment Report
(CEAR) based on its assessment of the submitted clinical evaluation
report and supporting documentation. If a design dossier report is
applicable to the device, the CEAR may be incorporated into this report
or referenced from it. The report should clearly identify the notified
body's assessment, verification on each of the critical elements and
overall conclusions. The CEAR at a minimum should address the notified
body's assessment of manufacturer's application relating to the
following: -
device description and product specification
-
intended purpose of the device
-
classification proposed for the device
-
pre-clinical evaluation data presented by the manufacturer
-
risk analysis and risk management and alignment with the clinical
evaluation report
-
clinical evaluation process
-
clinical evaluation report authors
-
equivalence assessment -- if data from equivalent is used
-
clinical investigation plans and reports
-
justification if no clinical investigation has been performed
-
instructions for use, labelling and, when necessary, the training plan
for users
-
justification if no PMCF is planned
-
PMS
-
PMCF
-
planned frequency/ criteria for updates to the clinical evaluation
-
summary of review
-
conclusion on clinical benefit/risk profile
-
conformance of the device to the relevant Essential Requirements
The CEAR should also provide details relating to the submission and
notified body review (including staff and experts involved in the review
and the aspects assessed by each, signatures of responsible reviewers,
etc.) The notified body should justify and document each step of the
decision making process referred in section A12.2.1 above.
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4
page 60 of 65
The CEAR at a minimum should include a summary of the information
provided by the manufacturer relating to the following: -
Record whether the clinical evaluation documentation is complete in
accordance with this document and adequate to demonstrate conformance to
the Essential Requirements of the relevant Directive.
-
Record the notified body's verification of each step of the clinical
evaluation process, from the planning of the clinical evaluation, choice
of route(s), identification, appraisal, analysis and overall assessment
of the clinical data, to concluding and reporting
-
Record the notified body's assessment of the clinical investigation data
and/or literature review assembled, relevant procedures and compliance
to relevant standards
-
Verify that the device has met the claimed performance/ intended purpose
and benefits, and that undesirable side-effects and risks have been
properly evaluated
-
Record the notified body's assessment of the clinical safety, clinical
performance and benefit/risk profile
-
Record the notified body's assessment of the overall conclusions drawn
by the manufacturer from the clinical data presented
-
Record the notified body's assessment of the validity of the clinical
evaluation and its steps
-
Record the notified body's conclusions on the clinical evaluation,
documenting each step in the decision making process as per Section
A12.2.1.
A12.2.3.
Clinical data from an equivalent device and other products
a. Equivalent devices The notified body should clearly document its
assessment of clinical data presented from an equivalent device as part
of a clinical evaluation. This should critically review and conclude on
the equivalence or not of the device under assessment to the devices
presented as equivalent in terms of their technical, biological and
clinical characteristics. The relevance of each dataset from an
equivalent device should be clearly evident and assessed by the notified
body. The notified body should also assess and document the level of
access to the technical and clinical data from an Equivalent device that
the manufacturer has. Relevant information may be commercially
sensitive/ confidential and not available to the manufacturer. The
notified body should challenge the ability of the manufacturer to access
information that are relevant to the demonstration of equivalence.
Demonstration of equivalence might be difficult or impossible in case of
limited access to the technical documentation of the devices. b. Other
products For hazard identification and when assessing the benefit/risk
profile of the device, the notified body should consider current
knowledge/ the state of the art. The notified body should assess the
appropriateness of the use of data from benchmark devices, other
devices, and medical alternatives.
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4

A12.3. Evaluation as part of quality system related procedures23
A12.3.1.
Review of the manufacturer's procedures
The notified body shall, as part of the review of the manufacturer's
quality system, assess the establishment, maintenance and application of
the manufacturer's documented procedures for the evaluation of clinical
data. This should cover: a. the proper assignment of responsibilities to
suitably qualified persons involved in the clinical evaluation (e.g.
clinical evaluator(s), information retrieval expert(s), expert(s) in
clinical research); b. the integration of clinical evaluation into the
quality system as a continuous process, to be specifically inter-related
to, and informed by, pre clinical evaluation and risk management; c.
standard operating procedures to assure proper planning, conduct,
evaluation, control and documentation planning of the clinical
evaluation, identification of clinical data (previous section),
literature searching (previous section), collection of clinical
experience (previous section), clinical investigation (previous section
and EN ISO 14155), appraisal of clinical data (previous section),
analysis of clinical data (previous section), concluding, reporting
(previous section) and update of clinical evaluation, procedures,
reporting and updating based on data from the PMS system and from PMCF
(MEDDEV 2.12/2 rev.2); d. document control as part of overall
documentation of procedures, reporting, qualifications and technical
documentation/design dossier(s); e. identification and evaluation of
undesirable side-effects and of clinical performance(s). This involves
identification of known or reasonably foreseeable hazards and
verification of unfavourable and favourable outcome(s), qualification of
their severity/magnitude and of their probability of occurrence. (It is
part of the manufacturer's documented risk analysis based on both
favourable and unfavourable data identified as relevant in order to give
a balanced view).
A12.3.2.
Review of the technical documentation of representative samples
The notified body is required to assess the technical documentation for
class IIa and class IIb devices on a representative basis. The clinical
evaluation report should be assessed by the notified body for at least
one representative sample for each device subcategory for class IIa
devices and at least one representative sample for each generic device
group for class IIb devices. Further representative samples have to be
assessed as part of the annual surveillance assessment cycle. Regarding
the choice of representative sample(s) the notified body will consider
the novelty of the technology, similarities in design, technology,
manufacturing and sterilisation methods, the intended purpose, and the
results of previous relevant assessments. Assessment of representative
samples includes assessment of the clinical evaluation report and
available clinical data in accordance with the review procedure in this
document rather than solely confirming that the manufacturer has a
clinical evaluation procedure in place or that the clinical evaluation
report is available. The criteria for the technical documentation
assessment on a representative basis outlined in NBOG BPG 2009-4 should
be applied.
23
According to Article 11 MDD (Annex II.3 MDD, or Annex III MDD coupled
with Annex IV, V or VI), and Article 9 AIMDD.
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4
page 62 of 65
When performing the assessment on samples of a manufacturer's clinical
evaluation, the notified body will follow the steps indicated in
previous sections of this document. A clinical evaluation assessment
report should be completed and available for each device sampled and
assessed.
A12.4. Notified body specific procedures and expertise A notified body
should have formal procedures in place controlled by their quality
system relating to the assessment of clinical evaluation reports and
associated data provided by medical device manufacturers. These
procedures should also cover the review of updates to the clinical
evaluation report during their scheduled surveillance activities and at
the time of changes to or extensions of EC design-examination/EC
type-examination certificates. Notified bodies should establish and
implement internal policies and procedures for the assessment of
clinical evaluation reports and associated data in order to: a. Ensure
that suitable resources, especially clinical competence necessary for
such assessment, are available within24 the notified body to conduct and
manage assessments of clinical evaluations for the notified body,
normally a qualified medical doctor. Such expertise should be sufficient
to conduct a complete review of the clinical data and clinical
evaluation presented for a particular device, to identify and estimate
the risks and benefits associated with the use of the medical devices
and to identify what, if any, specific clinical expertise is required
for the full assessment of the device. The assessment team should be
able to assess a risk analysis, the risk management strategy performed
by the manufacturer, and the scientific validity of clinical
investigations and publications. The assessment team should have
sufficient expertise in the device technology as the associated medical
procedures. Such an assessment requires input from a qualified medical
practitioner (for example physician, dentist, nurse, etc.), as
appropriate for the particular device, who has clinical experience in
using the device or similar devices, the pathology of the condition
being treated, the usual treatment, other medical alternatives, etc. The
notified body clinical assessor may work with external clinical experts.
The notified body clinical assessor should ensure that any experts are
appropriately aware of the relevant legislation, guidance and standards
and to identify specific aspects of the clinical data evaluation for
their specific review. Notified bodies should have robust procedures
around the recruitment, selection, training, conflict of interest and
interaction with external clinical experts including clear procedures
around how the expert opinion is documented and integrated with the
notified body assessment and considered as part of the overall
certificate decision. When examining the results of clinical
investigations, the assessment team shall have knowledge in planning,
conduct and interpretation of clinical investigations. All assessors
should be appropriately trained and qualified.
24
Annex XI.3 of Directive 93/42/EEC. This presupposes the availability of
sufficient scientific staff within the organisation who possess
experience and knowledge sufficient to assess the medical functionality
and performance of devices for which it has been notified, having regard
to the requirements of this Directive and, in particular, those set out
in Annex I.
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4
page 63 of 65
Particular attention should be drawn to training of external experts on
the conformity assessment procedure(s), relevant guidance, standards and
the context of the assessment they are providing. The notified body
should be responsible for reviewing the opinion of these experts, taking
account of their level of knowledge of the provisions of the Directives.
The opinion of an external clinical expert may form part of the
assessment conducted by the notified body. The opinion and conclusions
of the notified body, in part based on this external opinion, should be
clearly documented. The impartiality and the potential for conflict of
interest of an external expert reviewer should be assessed and
documented by the notified body. b. Review the clinical evaluation
report and clinical data provided by the manufacturer. The notified body
should verify the validity of key statements made in the clinical
evaluation report. The notified body should consider - statements based
on published literature using the full text version of publications; -
statements based on clinical data generated from PMS systems in
particular PMCF and source verification of such data; - statements
regarding equivalence to other devices using the original full text
version of pre-market study reports assessing parameters of interest. -
statements regarding results of own clinical investigations of the
manufacturer using the original full text version of the clinical
investigation plan and the clinical investigation report. The review of
the notified body should consider the scientific validity of the
clinical data set presented as part of the clinical evaluation and
decide as to whether it provides evidence that the clinical benefit
outweighs all associated risks. The data presented by the manufacturer
should be scientifically robust and well presented, it should be
complete and clear in its reasoning and should be of sufficient quality
and validity to demonstrate the conclusions which are being drawn. All
clinical data relevant to the device in question, both favourable and
unfavourable, should be considered, appraised and assessed by the
manufacturer and likewise by the notified body. An absence of
unfavourable data relating to a medical device should be carefully
examined. Clinical evaluation reports which are based on incomplete,
unclear or uncertain datasets should not be accepted. Clinical
Evaluation reports which are based on incomplete clinical investigations
or clinical investigations which were halted or terminated earlier than
their intended duration should be carefully examined and a robust
justification for halting or termination should be sought. The original
endpoints, objectives and statistical basis for the manufacturer's
clinical investigation are unlikely to remain valid in circumstances
when an investigation is completed prior to its original planned
duration and so it is unlikely that scientific conclusions can be drawn.
c. Document the opinion with rationale of all experts involved. d.
Document the result of their assessment. This is achieved through a
specific clinical evaluation assessment report which may be part of, or
may be referenced, in the overall audit report, design / type
examination report (as per A12.2.2 of this document) or the report on
the assessment of representative samples' documentation. e. Preserve
confidentiality of the information and data received from the
manufacturer, especially within the terms for contracting external
experts. MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4
page 64 of 65
f.
Clearly identify how data from PMS conducted by manufacturers, vigilance
and market surveillance information from competent authorities, PMCF
data, and data from other relevant sources (e.g. clinical literature) is
identified and reviewed by the notified body. This should clearly
describe how, when and what criteria are used by the notified body to
judge when a reassessment of the benefit/risk profile of a particular
device is deemed necessary.
