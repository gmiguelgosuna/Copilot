Scope of Document This best practice guidance document has been
developed by members of Team NB who have reviewed the best practice
guidance documents (exceeding twenty in number) submitted by individual
Team NB notified body members, with the purpose to develop a unified
approach on the expectations of technical documentation submissions from
manufacturers. This technical documentation submission guidance is
aligned to the requirements of Medical Devices Regulation \[MDR\] (EU)
2017/745, described in detail in Annexes II and III of Regulation (EU)
2017/745. Disclaimer: The content of the best practice guidance is based
on the interpretation of the Medical Device Regulation EU 2017/745 by
Team NB and affiliated notified bodies. During a technical documentation
assessment, it may be required that additional documentation/information
may be needed to be submitted as part of the technical assessment that
goes beyond what is listed in this guidance document, and each notified
body reserves the right to request additional information. This guidance
is intended to be comprehensive, but not exhaustive in its request.
Reference to MDCG guidance documents should be considered as suggested
guidance for the purposes of this document.

General Considerations The most common reasons for delays in Technical
Documentation assessments by notified bodies are: •

Incomplete Submissions -- Insufficient or missing information not
provided that is required for the conformity assessment activities. This
includes an incomplete or inconsistent description of devices covered by
the application and the related Technical Documentation (variants,
accessories, combined devices covered by the Basic UDI-DI to be
assessed).

•

Lack of Cohesive Structure of Technical Documentation - The information
is presented within the Technical Documentation but is difficult to
locate.

To avoid delays and to further improve your submission, please consider
the following practical points:

Communication with the notified body before an application is lodged ✓
Manufacturers should contact their notified body to clarify the language
requirements for the technical documentation submission of the
individual notified body as mentioned in MDR Article 52 (12). ✓
Manufacturers should also contact their notified body to clarify the
requirements related to documentation labelling and methods for
submission to the notified body. ✓ Additional guidance on topics
suitable for discussion with the notified body prior to submission are
provided in MDCG 2019-6 Section: I.6.3. What is considered "structured
dialogue"?

Technical documentation submission ✓ The technical documentation must be
provided in a clear, organised, readily searchable and unambiguous
manner per Annex II. The submission should be accompanied by an index or
table of contents with appropriate hyperlinks, as necessary, to aid
navigation. The number of folders should be kept to a minimum and if
possible, follow a logical flow per Annex II of MDR. Manufacturers are
advised to contact the notified body prior to submission and agree the
preferred folder structure. ✓ It is important for manufacturers to
provide good quality translations of technical documentation; poor
quality translations may, at a minimum, lead to additional questions and
time spent on the assessment and, at worst, could lead to a negative
recommendation for certification. ✓ The most recently updated
comprehensive reports and data should be included. Abbreviated or
partial test reports are not considered acceptable. ✓ Verification
reports provided should be complete, i.e. not a report with subsequent
amendments or revisions as the device was changed. ✓ The technical
documentation should document how the manufacturer ensures compliance to
every applicable MDR Annex I GSPR. Note that, per section, a simple
collection of test/verification reports does not fulfil this
requirement. For example, verification and validation protocols and
reports should be linked to the risks identified in the risk assessment;
therefore it will be clear which risks are mitigated by the indicated
documents. ✓ There are many areas of the technical documentation that
will require the duplication of information for multiple documents such
as device description. Please ensure that the information is correct
throughout all areas where this information is duplicated and consider
the risk of potential errors/inconsistencies when updating (e.g. Basic
UDI-DI, UDI-DI, intended use, indications for use, contraindications,
warnings, etc.). ✓ Ensure the data in the technical documentation is
consistent with the data provided in the respective application forms. ✓
Valid justifications should always be provided or accompanied where
there are deficiencies in the requested data. ✓ Where ISO standards are
mentioned in this guidance, please consider conformance to the
state-of-the-art (SOTA). Where appropriate, please provide a rationale
and/or gap analysis to justify the use of a standard version that is not
aligned with the SOTA. As part of the technical documentation
assessment, please be aware that there are multiple individuals from the
notified body involved in the assessment and therefore you may be
requested to provide duplication of documents. During the final
technical documentation assessment, additional evidence/documents may
also be required.

Leveraging of evidence from previous conformity assessments For certain
classifications of medical devices, the MDR requires that manufacturers
submit an initial application for certification under MDR to notified
bodies (NBs). NBs are required to undertake the applicable conformity
assessment activities, typically a combination of quality management
system audits and technical documentation assessments to verify
compliance to the MDR requirements before certification can be granted.
For certain cases, it may be possible to leverage evidence from previous
conformity assessments to support initial MDR certification. In the case
of conformity assessments previously performed by the notified body
under the Directives (or the MDR) and where the requirements have not
changed significantly, and the evidence provided by the manufacturer to
meet such requirements has not changed, the notified body may be able to
leverage/utilise sections from the previous assessments (e.g.
sterilisation or packaging) to establish compliance to the MDR
requirements without having to re-evaluate the evidence. In this case,
the review ID / project number or other identifier should be provided.
Such an approach could help avoid duplication and reduce the durations
of the NB MDR conformity assessment activities and hence contribute to
faster transition of medical devices from the Directives to the MDR. It
is important to note that the manufacturer should continue to provide
full technical documentation in line with Annex II and Annex III of the
MDR. However, it would aid the NB technical documentation assessment
process if manufacturers clearly indicate whether the evidence/data they
have submitted as part of the MDR application (or technical
documentation) already provided within another MDD/MDR application has
changed or not; the extent of changes compared to what may have been
previously assessed by their notified body (this may be provided
separately or included in the GSPR checklist) under the Directives; and
references to NB reports where such evidence was previously assessed.
Please tell the NB where and when the subject device was previously
assessed (e.g. reference the previous assessment number).

whether the device is for single use only, multiple use, reprocessing
and its number of cycles should be included. Additionally, the
applicable MDA/MDN/MDS/MDT code per (EU) 2017/2185 should be reported.
The general device description should enable understanding of the
design, packaging, sterilisation, or other characteristics of the
device. Sufficient information should be provided to understand the
intended purpose and the different design features. The intended purpose
or intended use should include enough details to enable ready
understanding of the medical device per article 2 (12). See more
information in the Clinical Evaluation section of this BPG Provide
enough detail to explain the disease conditions the device is intended
to treat or monitor. The intended users of the device (e.g. Physicians,
surgeons in a specialty, clinical nurses, laypersons, etc.) should be
identified.

\(b\) the Basic UDI-DI as referred to in Part C of Annex VI assigned by
the manufacturer to the device in question, as soon as identification of
this device becomes based on a UDI system, or otherwise a clear
identification by means of product code, catalogue number or other
unambiguous reference allowing traceability. -

Clear identification of device by unambiguous reference, allowing
traceability (Basic UDI-DI), together with other traceable reference
number (e.g. product code, catalogue number, etc.). Information to be

\-

The Technical Documentation should include intended patient population
(including intended parts of the body or type of tissue applied to or
interacted with) and medical conditions to be diagnosed, treated and/or
monitored and other considerations such as patient selection criteria,
indications, contra-indications and warnings, intended conditions of use
(environment, frequency, location, mobility). See more information in
the Clinical Evaluation section of this BPG

\(d\) principles of operation of the device and its mode of action,
scientifically demonstrated if necessary. - Please include a detailed
explanation of how the device is intended to function. Include the
principles of physics, chemistry, mechanics, biodegradation etc. that
enable the device to function as intended. The amount of information to
be included shall be commensurate with the complexity of the device. The
scientific demonstration may include the design verification and
validation, including pre-clinical or clinical studies, and other
relevant information. (e) the rationale for the qualification of the
product as a device. - Per MDR, Article 2, please explain how the
product qualifies as a medical device. Or explain if it is a product
without an intended medical purpose (Annex XVI). Please note this is
different from the classification of the device per MDR Annex VIII. -
Consider the use of the various guidance documents and manuals in help
determining the classification of borderline devices. (f) the risk class
of the device and the justification for the classification rule(s)
applied in accordance with Annex VIII. - Please indicate the device
classification and rationale per MDR Annex VIII. Each potentially
applicable rule shall be listed and justification why they are
applicable or not applicable shall be documented. Upon selection of the
applicable classification rule, each point of the rule shall be
justified. If multiple classification rules apply, all should be
identified and the strictest rules resulting in the higher
classification should apply. - If the device contains multiple
components that on their own might be classed differently, this shall be
documented. Please note the higher classification should apply. - For
guidance on classification, see MDCG 2021-24. If medical device is
standalone software, guidance for the qualification and classification
of the software can be found in MDCG 201911. There should be a rationale
for why the software is a medical device and for its classification. If
applicable, the software should be broken down into modules, some that
have a medical purpose and some that do not. The modules with a medical
purpose must comply with the requirements of the MDR and must carry the
CE marking. The non-medical device modules are not subject to the
requirements for medical devices. - For "borderline products", see MDCG
2022-5 and Manual on borderline and classification for medical devices
under Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices.

NB has been notified of all significant changes (if applicable). For
initial applications under MDR, please confirm whether the device has
been previously marketed under MDD and whether any changes have been
made in comparison to the MDDcertified device. Market history should
include EU and approvals in other geographies, including sales volumes
per country. If the device is a system, ensure that the number of units
sold is broken down by device component and per year.

\(b\) an overview of identified similar devices available on the Union
or international markets, where such devices exist. - Refer to MDR
article 2 (7) and MDCG 2020-5, section 5 for the definition of similar
device and its relevance. - Provide an overview of identified similar
devices available on the EU or international markets if such devices
exist. This should include a comparison of these devices with the device
under assessment to show the similarities and differences. Note: The
similar devices identified in this section should align with those
identified in the clinical evaluation, including the PMCF plan.

1.3 Common pitfalls in device description & specifications •

•

•

Inconsistencies are observed within the various documentation: For
example, abbreviations are used in DoC, while the labelling uses the
full device name, or the variants and configurations (including
packaging configurations) are not very clear or are inconsistent
throughout the TD. Rationales for various definitions and
classifications are not detailed enough: For example, for devices
including a drug substance, justification is not included as to why the
drug substance is considered ancillary to the mechanical action of the
device. Contraindications do not include specific anatomy or special
population when no evidence for the safe use in such anatomy/special
population is provided.

2\. Information to be Supplied by the Manufacturer (Includes Declaration
of Conformity, Labelling, IFU, Implant Card, Surgical Technique brochure
etc.) 2.1 Declaration of Conformity (DoC) For devices being assessed for
initial MDR certification, please provide a draft EU Declaration of
Conformity according to MDR Annex IV. For devices already MDR certified,
please provide a signed EU Declaration of Conformity.

2.2 Labelling ▪

Please provide the label or labels on the medical device, in the
languages accepted in the Member States where the device is envisaged to
be sold. This includes Device or Product labelling, Sterile packaging
labelling, Single unit packaging labelling, Sales packaging labelling,
Transport packaging labelling and labels displayed in software.

▪

Please also include information on markings or labelling applied on the
device itself (if any), including a specification of the method by which
it is applied (e.g. laser marking of titanium implants).

▪

Medical devices generally use multiple levels of labelling, and it is
recognised that not all devices may have the different levels of
packaging specified in this section or different terms may be used than
those specified here. Legible versions of all applicable levels of
labels should be provided (e.g. secondary pack, primary pack) and should
be representative of the finished form, showing all included symbols.

▪

Provide drawings with the packaging configuration (showing placement of
all labels) and label specifications (layout, size).

▪

The position of labels on the finished product should be clear. If the
device has a sterile package, clearly identify the label for the sterile
package. If any of the packaging is printed with information for the
user (including pictures / schematics of the device) this should also be
provided.

▪

Verification of label contents must be carried out in accordance with
MDR Annex I GSPR 23. There is a commitment by the Manufacturer to apply
UDI carriers on the device label as per MDR Article 27(4) and depending
on the classification of the medical devices as per MDR Article 123 part
3(f).

▪

Please ensure that any specific requirements of mandatory harmonised
standards or Common Specification (CS) are addressed in the labels and
information for use. For example, EN ISO 152231 defines symbols to be
used in labelling, or the CS for Annex XVI devices include labelling
requirements. In addition, the specific requirements for the label and
IFU of all other harmonised and non-harmonised standards which are
applied must be implemented in the IFU.

▪

Within the technical file, please provide a list of EU countries in
which the medical device is intended to be marketed and evidence that
the national requirements of the languages used are adhered to. In the
case where the marketed countries are not fully defined yet, a master
template in the language required by the notified body may be acceptable
for initial MDR certification. After initial MDR certification, all
languages should be included in the latest technical file.

2.3 Instructions for use/Device Operating Manual(s) ▪

Please provide the instructions for use (IFU), in the languages accepted
in the Member States where the device is envisaged to be sold.
Manufacturers must ensure that the information within the IFUs,
especially related to intended purpose, indications, contra-indications,
and other safety related information such as side effects, warnings is
aligned with similar information from other sections such as risk
management, clinical evaluation, usability, pre-clinical performance
data etc.

▪

IFUs must contain all the information required as per applicable
requirements specified within MDR Annex I GSPR 23.

▪

Please ensure that any specific requirements of relevant standards or CS
are addressed by the IFU. For example EN 60601-1, EN 60601-1-X, EN
60601-2-X, EN ISO 17664, EN ISO 14630 have specific requirements for the
IFU.

for initial MDR certification. After initial MDR certification, all
languages should be included in the latest technical file.

2.4 Electronic IFU (e-IFU) information (if applicable, and as per (EU)
2021/2226) ▪

If electronic IFU will be utilised, ensure compliance has been clearly
outlined and evidence included to demonstrate compliance with all
relevant aspects of Regulation 2021/2226. To ensure unconditional access
to the e-IFU and to facilitate the communication of updates, those
instructions should be available on the website of the manufacturer in
an official language(s) of the Union determined by the Member State in
which the device is made available to the user or patient. Instructions
for use in electronic form, which are provided in addition to complete
instructions for use in paper form, should be consistent with the
content of the instructions for use in paper form.

▪

Please submit e-labelling information as provided on the device or on a
leaflet.

▪

Provide documented risk assessment covering the elements as required by
the e-labelling regulation (this can be in the Risk Management section
of the technical file).

2.5 Patient handbook Some devices incorporate all the information
relevant for the patient/user within the IFU itself. Some devices are
accompanied by a patient handbook with additional instructions specific
to the patient, for example with devices (or parts, components of the
devices) that are patient operated. If the device is supplied with a
patient handbook, this should be provided in the languages accepted in
the Member States where the device is envisaged to be sold. The planned
approach for translation of any information not in harmonised symbols
should be described, if applicable.

2.6 Physicians'/other users' handbook If a separate physicians' handbook
is relevant for the device, this should be provided in the languages
accepted in the Member States where the device is envisaged to be sold.
The planned approach for translation of any information not in
harmonised symbols should be described, if applicable.

2.7 Implant card information Please provide the implant card and
information to be supplied to the patient with an implanted device, if
applicable. The implant card and other information per Article 18 of
MDR, and any additional TEAM-NB

information as specified in the MDCG guidance (MDCG 2019-8) on implant
cards should be included. The device type according to MDCG 2021-11
should be included. The location of the implant card within the device
or system packaging should be clearly specified. The planned approach
for translation of any information not in harmonised symbols should be
described, if applicable.

2.8 Copies of promotional materials (that mention that the device
fulfils the requirements of CE marking) including any that make specific
claims related to the device ▪ ▪

Only marketing literature that mention that the device fulfils the
requirements of CE marking or includes the CE mark itself is required to
be provided. Supporting evidence should be provided in the relevant
pre-clinical and clinical sections to substantiate any claims made in
the labelling or marketing literature.

2.9 URL of the website where the IFU and/or any other labelling
information as relevant will be made available as per MDR Annex I GSPR
23.1 MDR Annex I GSPR 23.1 requires that information related to
identification, and safety and performance of the device should be made
available and kept up to date on the manufacturer's website if the
manufacturer has a website. The URL of the website where such
information will be made available should be included.

2.10 Common Pitfalls for Information to be Supplied by the Manufacturer
•

• •

Basic UDI-DIs are being assigned incorrectly -- this leads to amendments
during the technical assessment. Please ensure the correct Basic UDI-DI
is assigned when technical documentation is first submitted to the
notified body. IFU -- the intended use and the indications are being
used interchangeably. Please use MDCG 2020-6 definitions. Ensure there
is 1:1 alignment across all the information provided -- do not let the
SSCP deviate from the IFU or the patient information leaflet.

3\. Design & Manufacturing Information Please provide information to
allow the design stages applied to the device to be understood. Design
stages/phases are typically closed by phase reviews with meeting minutes
and a report, which can be informative enough. Standard operating
procedures (SOPs) for design and development are not required; these
typically do not apply to the specific device and will not provide
understanding on the design stages of the particular device. Please
provide detailed description of manufacturing processes including:

Identification of the process(es) concerned. Identification of the
number and date of previous assessment report, with a satisfactory
outcome. - A rationale for the proposed inclusion of the device, which
is the subject of the assessment, in the validation of the process
previously assessed (inclusion of the product within a defined family
without challenging the worst-case scenario). ▪ If the device is
required to be installed and/or commission at the user location, please
provide information on tests to be carried out as a part of the
installation and commissioning of the device. As a general principle, if
any of the information requested in the Manufacturing section is not
available in English, the Manufacturer should either provide
translations or provide supplementary summary reports with translations
of relevant information/sections. Or in cases where the
information/reports are data heavy (or mainly graphical in nature) with
very few words, the Manufacturer may annotate English translations of
relevant words within the reports.

3.1 Sites and Subcontractors The manufacturer should provide the
following documentation at a minimum: ▪ The name and address of any
critical subcontractors should be identified, along with the service or
material supplied by each. ▪ Copies of critical subcontractor ISO 13485
certificates or other relevant certificates based on the product /
service they provide. If a critical subcontractor does not have an ISO
13485 certificate from a notified body, additional supplier audits may
need to be arranged. ▪ Identification of subject medical device design
sites (identification of all sites, including subcontractors, where
design activities are performed, e.g. outsourced design units, research
sites, etc.). ▪ Identification of subject medical device manufacturing
process sites (identification of all sites, including information of
manufacturing stages and critical sub-contractors, where manufacturing
activities are performed). ▪ Quality assurance agreements with critical
subcontractors (in case of sterile medical devices, the contract with

accreditation certificate, etc.). ▪ If multisite companies are present,
specify the site(s) involved in the design / manufacturing of the
subject medical device. • Where legal manufacturers have their devices
designed or manufactured by another legal or natural person, the name,
address and contact details of that other person should be submitted to
the database in EUDAMED electronic system (requirement only applicable
from 18 months after the date of publication in EU O. J. of EUDAMED's
full functionality).

4\. General Safety & Performance Requirements (GSPRs) The manufacturer
should provide clear, organised, readily searchable and unambiguous
documentation. For example, a compliance matrix/checklist/or other
document that includes the following: (1) Each GSPR of MDR Annex I that
applies to the device and an explanation as to why other GSPRs do not
apply to the device. EXAMPLE: A decision column \"applicable versus not
applicable\" for each clause/sub-clause of MDR, Annex I. A \"rationale\"
column on each clause/sub-clause of MDR, Annex I, that apply to the
device, with an explanation as to why others do not apply. (2) The
method or methods used to demonstrate conformity with each applicable
GSPR. EXAMPLE: A column \"methods used to demonstrate conformity\", with
each clause/sub-clause of MDR Annex I. (3) Harmonised standards, Common
Specification (CS), or other solutions applied (please refer to the
specific edition/issue date). EXAMPLE: A column \"applied standards, CS
or others\", for each clause/sub-clause of MDR, respectively. NOTE 1 to
(3): This is usually accomplished by means of a list of applied
standards and CS, as well as by reference to appropriate standards and
CS in the appropriate documents (e.g. test reports). NOTE 2 to (3):
Indicate if full or partial compliance is being claimed. Where (i) key
standards or CS have not been applied or not been applied in full, (ii)
a manufacturer chooses to use a newer version of a currently harmonised
standard, (iii) outdated standards are applied: in all these cases, an
appropriate justification should be provided in the Technical
Documentation, in the form of a summary or gap analysis regarding
ability to comply with associated General Safety & Performance
Requirements (Annex I), and a risk analysis and a duly justified
conclusion of acceptability of any compliance gaps. NOTE 3 to (3): Refer
also to additional applicable standards, and/or Directives -- e.g.
Machinery, EMC, RoHS, European Pharmacopoeia, scientific opinions,
guidance as necessary to show consideration of the state of the art.
NOTE 4 to (3): Where other solutions have been applied, i.e. there are
no standards or CS applied, please provide a justification and, where
relevant, the qualification/validation of the method showing that the
method is at least equal or better than the ones listed in the standard
or CS. (4) The precise identity of the controlled documents offering
evidence of conformity with each harmonised standard, CS, or other
method applied to demonstrate conformity with the GSPR.

Notified Bodies

EXAMPLE: A column to add the \"precise identity of the controlled
documents\" offering evidence of conformity. Identification should be as
\"Document ID, document date, section, point, page, chapter, link etc.\"
NOTE 1 to (4): This should include a cross- reference to the location of
that document (use precise references -- avoid general or generic
references) within the full Technical Documentation and, where
applicable, the summary of the technical documentation. The more
specific the references are to documents supporting compliance, the
faster the assessment can be conducted. NOTE 2 to (4): If no new testing
is required, a justification needs to be provided. (5) Version control
or document control, as per manufacturer quality management system
procedures (Draft documents should not be provided).

4.1 Common pitfalls in General Safety & Performance Requirements
(GSPRs): -

A justification why standards are (partially) applied to demonstrate
conformity to the GSPR of the MDR is absent. E.g., a standard for
vascular grafts is mentioned for a surgical mesh, with no explanation or
justification why this standard is applied, and which part of it.

\-

A systematic evaluation of relevant documents as relevant published
literature applicable to the device, best practice guidelines, and
standards is not part of the technical documentation. In consequence, it
is unclear why the selected test methods and acceptance criteria are
deemed valid to predict the clinical safety and performance of the
device.

\-

The GSPR requirement no. XX is identified as "not applicable"; however,
no justification/rationale is provided.

\-

GSPRs documentation does not include a clear and unambiguous reference
to where the evidence used to demonstrate compliance (for applicable
GSPRs) can be found inside the Technical Documentation provided.

5\. Benefit-Risk Analysis and Risk Management For risk management please
refer to the MDR requirements as stated in Annex I, clauses 1-9 and
Annex II, section 5. Please clearly indicate whether the risk management
process is based on EN ISO 14971. The interface between risk management
process and data from pre-clinical evaluations (product verification and
validation) and clinical evaluation performed by the manufacturer must
be clear and noticeable (refer to Annex VII, 4.5.4(c) and 4.5.5); and
the results of the risk management should provide information about the
appropriateness of the pre-clinical and clinical evaluation.

▪

Please provide a copy of risk management procedure(s) that include the
definition of any rating systems used for risk analysis and risk
acceptability. If this is part of a different document such as the risk
management plan or maintained as a separate document that is specific
for the subject device, then the relevant information must be included.

▪

Please provide copies of the relevant risk management documentation to
confirm that the risk management procedure is followed (including e.g.,
the usability risk management procedure, if applicable). Evidence of the
\"life-cycle management\" concept must be provided, i.e., the analysis
must be performed throughout the life cycle of the device, from design
to disposal, considering all the appropriate PMS data. Guidance on the
end of the obligation to update the PSUR is found in MDCG 2022-21.

▪

Please note that risk management documentation should comprise all parts
/ components of a device.

▪

Risk management should be understood as a continuous iterative process
throughout the entire lifecycle of a device, requiring regular
systematic updating.

▪

Please note that special requirements of Common Specifications on Risk
Management need to be included for devices covered by MDR, Annex XVI.

The requirements also apply in case of outsourced processes.

5.1 Risk management plan Please provide the risk management plan
associated with the device, including: - The scope of the risk
management activities. - The complete description and identification of
the devices and accessories in question. - The description of the life
cycle phases of the device. - Assignment of responsibilities and
authorities for risk management. - Identification of requirements for
review of risk management activities. - The system used for qualitative
or quantitative categorisation of -- as a minimum - probability of
occurrence of harm and severity of harm. - Definition of criteria for
acceptable risk levels. - Evaluation of any residual risk acceptability,
including overall residual risk. - Criteria for acceptability of the
overall residual risk, the method and evaluation of overall residual
risk. - Verification of the implementation of risk control measures. -
Verification of the effectiveness of risk control measures. -
Identification of activities for collection and review of production and
post-production information. Please provide evidence that the risk
management team comprises appropriately qualified persons, including
assignment of a clinical expert.

5.2 Risk analysis / risk control measures The documentation should
contain information on: - The benefit-risk analysis referred to in
section 1 and 8 of MDR Annex I. - The solutions adopted and the results
of the risk management referred to in section 3 of MDR Annex I. -
Evidence given that a safety concept in accordance with section 4 of MDR
Annex I is applied, including information to users of any residual
risk(s). The documentation should include: - Design risk assessment:
documented risk assessment for the design aspects of the device. -
Production/process risk assessment: documented risk assessment for the
production/manufacturing process aspects of the device. -
Clinical/Application/Product risk assessment: documented risk assessment
for the clinical usage/application aspects of the device. For design
risk assessment, an assessment should be provided whether any design
changes add new hazards or reduce the likelihood of occurrence of
existing hazards, irrespective of whether the risk assessment has
changed. Reduction of the risks related to use error should cover the
requirements set out in section 5 of MDR Annex I. For usability
evaluation please refer to the MDR requirements stated in Annex I,
clauses 14.6, 21.3, 22.1, 22.2, 23.1a, as well as to EN 62366-1. For
ease of assessment, it is recommended to provide a use flow-chart for
the device in question. Risk analysis should demonstrate: - All known
and foreseeable hazards associated with each device are identified and
analysed (i.e., estimation and evaluation of risks for each hazardous
situation). - All known and foreseeable risks, and any undesirable
side-effects, are minimised and acceptable when weighed against the
evaluated benefits to the patient and/or user arising from the achieved
performance of the device during normal conditions of use. - Estimation
and evaluation of risks associated with and occurring during intended
use and during reasonably foreseeable misuse are estimated and
evaluated, including eliminating or controlling these risks. -
Appropriate controls (i.e., process validations, biocompatibility,
sterilisation, clinical, shelf-life or other key verification/validation
tests) have reduced all risks as low as possible to acceptable levels
considering state-of-the-art for the product(s) under assessment. - Risk
control measures are implemented for each hazard (with references to the
documentation where these measures are implemented). - The effectiveness
of risk control measures is verified (with references to the
documentation where effectiveness of risk control measures is
demonstrated). - Residual risks and their processing operations are
identified, and the acceptability of any residual risk(s) is assessed. -
A statement is given that the clinical benefits outweigh all the
residual risks.

\-

Production and post-production information are evaluated regarding
hazards and their associated risks, as well as on the overall risk,
benefit-risk ratio and risk acceptability; and the control measures are
amended if necessary.

5.3 The risk analysis should cover (not limited to): -

Hazards related to all device components. Hazards related to clinical
use. Hazards related to ergonomic features of the device and the
environment in which the device is intended to be used. Hazards related
to technical knowledge, experience, education, training and use
environment of users. Hazards related to the medical and physical
conditions of intended users (lay, professional, disabled, etc.).
Hazards related to reuse (please note for single-use devices, GSPR
23.4(p) requires the risks of re-use to be addressed, this should be
identifiable). Hazards related to the manufacturing process. Hazards
related to cybersecurity. If applicable, any required risk evaluation
per commission implementing regulation (EU) 2022/2346.

Note: additional hazards are also given in EN ISO 14971.

5.4 Risk management report Please provide the risk management report
associated with the device, including: - The evaluation of any residual
risk(s) acceptability. - The evaluation of the overall residual risk
acceptability. - The evaluation of the benefit-risk ratio. A statement
should be provided that the device, when used within the intended
purpose, constitutes acceptable risks when weighed against the benefits
to the patient and is compatible with a high level of protection of
health and safety, considering the generally acknowledged state of the
art (MDR Annex I, 1). For MDR Annex XVI devices: a statement should be
provided that the device does not present a risk at all or presents a
risk that is no more than the maximum acceptable risk related to the
device use, which is consistent with a high level of protection for the
safety and health of persons (MDR Annex I, 9).

5.5 Common pitfalls in risk management -

The description of risk controls is not clear enough to understand what
has been done to reduce the risks. E.g., for risks related to deliberate
misuse, "IFU" is indicated as risk control, however it not described
which information has been added to this document to control the risk.

TEAM-NB

Notified Bodies

\-

\-

\-

Risk control measures described in the risk management file are not in
line with the risk control options under MDR Annex I GSPR 4. E.g.,
sterilisation validation is mentioned as risk control for biological
contamination due to reuse, however the validation itself is not a risk
control for this item (i.e. safe design and manufacture, protection
measures, information for safety, training to users). It is not
traceable in the risk management file which referred records relate to
verification of implementation and which to verification of
effectiveness of each risk. The levels for semi-quantitative
determination of occurrence rates do not reflect clinical reality. E.g.,
"occasional" is related to "in every 10-100 cases". Risks occurring in
every tenth patient would typically not be considered occasional, but
frequent. The risk management plan does not include clear criteria to
decide on risk acceptability. The MDR does not allow that the acceptance
of risks is alone decided based on risk prioritisation number (RPN),
"green" area or similar, but requires that the acceptability of each
risk is decided individually based on predefined criteria.

6\. Product Verification and Validation The following sections detail
specific technical documentation areas. While each section focuses on
its dedicated topic, some general technical documentation requirements
may be repeated for clarity. In general, the documentation should
contain the results and critical evaluation of all verifications and
validation tests and/or studies undertaken. For each test performed, the
resulting data should be critically analysed and linked towards
addressing specific GSPRs and/or related risk control measures. Annex II
6.1(b) states the following "Where no new testing has been undertaken,
the documentation shall incorporate a rationale for that decision". This
section is vitally important for previously marketed devices under the
directive applying for MDR certification. MDR applications are
considered an entirely new standalone applications from the original MDD
designation, however there is potential to use existing data where
justifiable and if the state of the art is met. As an example, for
devices previously marketed under the MDD there may be slight
differences from the MDD version of the device than the MDR version that
may have only required a partial retest rather than a complete
reverification and revalidation for MDR. In these instances, it is
critical that the manufacturer clearly and logically presents this data
to the notified body and that they clearly identify and outline what
testing is relevant to the current version of the device (this
requirement should also be taken in conjunction with MDR Annex II 1.2b).
If historic testing is referenced, but a subsequent change was made and
only some specifications were re-tested, please explain which test
reports are superseded and should be reviewed for each relevant
specification. If multiple design verification / validation studies were
conducted, please provide a flow chart or table that shows how the
studies were conducted and highlight which study ultimately demonstrates
that TEAM-NB

the design meets the product performance specifications (this
requirement should also be taken in conjunction with MDR Annex II 1.2b).
An overarching design/ development validation/verification plan(s)
should be provided along with associated report(s). The following points
are also relevant to real time and or accelerated aging studies;
adequate justification for not performing these studies on a design
element should be provided. All design requirements and specification
documents should be provided. A design control input/output matrix
should be provided; these traceability matrices shall contain traceable
sources to requirements (risk, regulatory performance etc.) and in turn
the identification of the protocols reports and test data documents in
the technical file relating to their verification and validation
including the test evidence. Accelerated aging and real time aging
requirements are often useful to add to their T=0 design element as a
line item in a matrix. The design matrix should clearly identify the
user needs the associated design input and essential design outputs and
link to the verification evidence and associated validation evidence.
The design matrix should be clearly presented and organised logically.
It may be beneficial, depending on the device, to have headings such as
Sterilisation, Biocompatibility, Packaging Requirements, Realtime,
Accelerated Aging requirements etc. individually organised and labelled
with sources of the requirements. If the device has multiple notified
body reviewers, then a logical organisation of this matrix can be of
great benefit to the reviewer(s) navigating the requirements. Protocols
or equivalent should contain a risk-based justification for the sampling
size selection when used. Protocols should contain any product specific
data or justifications for sample selection including acceptance
criteria, confidence intervals, tolerances, objectives, references to
test methods etc. Use of clear justification should be provided in the
protocols and their conclusions addressed for adequacy in the reports to
situations where test results are considered representative for a group
of devices, e.g. during comparative testing or worst-case conditions for
testing. Any pre-conditioning prior to testing should be documented in
advance and pre-condition test data should be included with the test
reports. If compliance is demonstrated without test evidence, it should
be clearly justified and detailed scientific/ engineering-based evidence
for the justification should be provided. Any discrepancies/ deviations
and their investigations should clearly be documented in the reports
along with the rational for acceptance and, if relevant, a CAPA
overview. Reports should clearly demonstrate the statistical inferences
being made and a link to the raw data provided in the test report or the
technical file. It can be beneficial to remember the statistical/test
requirements in the following way. Disclaimer: this may not be the
preferred approach of your notified body and is not considered guidance,
but more a general overview of good documentation practices; it is
always beneficial to check with your notified body first for their
preferred structure. TEAM-NB

Practical: The raw test data used to generate the data via a validated
test method or equivalent. Graphical: the graphical summary of the data
and any statistical inferences being made, e.g. histograms capability 6
packs normality plots etc. Analytical: The analytical data of the
analysis e.g. statistical software output demonstrating p values etc.
This is also a requirement for the conclusion in the associated report
used to demonstrate compliance to the applicable GSPR.

All outliers in statistical data need to be thoroughly investigated and
examined and a root cause provided and assigned before any conclusions
can be drawn. Outliers cannot simply be excluded and must be addressed.
Where necessary it is a requirement to demonstrate that the units used
for testing are reflective of the final unit; this may require unit
build/production information that is directly traceable to the
individual test. These can be provided in summary appendices to a
section in the report discussing such build information. If testing has
been undertaken on prototypes, previous generations of a device, or
devices that otherwise do not represent the finished goods, a
justification for the adequacy of this testing should be provided. In
instances where contract test laboratories have been used the
manufacturer must provide a bridge between their protocol and reports
and the contractors reports protocols where necessary. Accreditation/
certification credentials should also be referenced in the technical
file for these test centres. In terms of the lifetime of the device
there should be sufficient evidence to support the claims made; it
should not be considered that product lifetime is equivalent to shelf
life. Depending on the device type, appropriate statistical data should
be included to demonstrate the reliability of the device over its
lifetime in use. Lifetime requirements should also take into
consideration other key elements such as risk management, post market
surveillance and clinical evaluation.

6.1.2 Software & Software Validation (Including Cyber Security) General
Overview This section offers a consolidated overview of the complete
technical documentation requirements. It summarises key information
already discussed in previous sections, aiming for brevity. The
technical documentation requirements detailed earlier are relevant for
SaMD, MDSW and SIMD. A clear statement and documented rationale as to
why the product is a Medical Device is required. Based on the standard
used for compliance, a standards compliance checklist to the
requirements based on the software's risk category is recommended.
Direct references to where in the technical file the evidence of meeting
the requirements of the chosen standard is located should be present in
any compliance checklist presented. If a different standard has been
used than that of the harmonised version(s), then a detailed document
should be provided that explains how the requirements of the harmonised
version have been met or exceeded should be provided along with the
evidence. The Software safety classification should be provided and the
justification for it should be clearly identified in the technical file.
The software version under application should be clearly identified in
the application. A software traceability matrix that contains traceable
sources to requirements (risk, regulatory performance etc.) and in turn
the identification of the protocols reports and test data documents
relating to their verification and validation test evidence are
beneficial to the assessment. As stated previously, these documents
should also be submitted in the technical documentation. The software
standards applied to the device should also be identified in the
technical documentation, provide evidence of consideration of all
related harmonised and non-harmonised /SOTA software standards /
guidance(s). Note: Some documentation may or may not be required per the
standards based on software system/module/item risk classification.

Common pitfalls in sterile packaging validation ▪ ▪

▪ ▪ ▪ ▪ ▪ ▪

The packaging process validation does not test the boundaries of the
process. Validation of only one sealing/forming/assembly machine from a
pool of machines which are used in routine for sealing/forming/assembly.
The stated "machine equivalence" is only a theoretical assumption based
on the position that technically identical equipment performs identical
without substantiation by data. Mechanical and/or climatic hazards to be
expected during the routine transportation are not covered by the
performed transport simulation. The worst-case constellation of
product/packaging/sterilisation is not tested in the transport
validation. In accelerated aging studies, the upper limit of the claimed
storage temperature range is not covered by the calculation of the
accelerated aging time. During accelerated aging, the relative humidity
must be controlled or a rationale for exclusion of humidity control must
be documented, which is frequently missed. Labelling integrity and
readability after transport simulation as well as after aging is often
not investigated. The applied test method is not validated at all, or
the applied test method is not adequate for the packaging characteristic
intended to be proven.

6.1.5 Performance and Safety - Design Verification and Validations

Compatibility) The manufacturer should provide the following

accuracies etc. Testing to relevant standards (e.g. EN 80601 series
\[essential performance\] for Active medical devices) should be provided
if compliance to these is claimed. Protocol & report should provide the
evidence for all variants/configurations of the device, should cover
interconnections to accessories and parts of the device. Evidence should
demonstrate compliance for the environmental conditions specified for
the device and for the lifetime of the device (or service periods
prescribed). If the device is to be connected to other device(s) to
operate as intended, a description of this combination/configuration
including proof that it conforms to the general safety and performance
requirements when connected to any such device(s) having regard to the
characteristics specified by the manufacturer. For tests conducted by a

undesirable side-effects and of the acceptability of the
benefit-riskratio referred to in Sections 1 and 8 of Annex I, should be
based on clinical data providing sufficient clinical evidence, including
where applicable relevant data as referred to in Annex III.

The manufacturer should specify and justify the level of clinical
evidence necessary to demonstrate conformity with the relevant general
safety and performance requirements. That level of clinical evidence
should be appropriate in view of the characteristics of the device and
its intended purpose. To that end, manufacturers should plan, conduct
and document a clinical evaluation in accordance with this Article and

\*Literature search protocols and reports covering the objectives to
systematically evaluate the State of Art and to find all available
clinical evidence supporting the device under evaluation can be provided
as stand-alone documents or included as part of CEP or CER. A full text
copy of relevant articles should also be provided. \*\*PMCF report can
be provided as a stand-alone document or included as part of the CER For
additional information on specific device types please refer to the
notes below: Note 1: Where an opinion has been provided by the expert
panels on the clinical strategy of the device(s) per Article 61 (2), the
manufacturer should also provide a copy of the opinion and reference.
Note 2: In the case of orphan devices and devices with an orphan
indication, the manufacturer must provide a justification for the orphan
status and any views expressed the European Expert Panels (if
consulted). For guidance on orphan status criteria and the justification
for orphan status, refer to MDCG 2024-10. Note 3: In the case of devices
which fall under Article 54 (Class III Implantable and Class IIb Active
devices intended to administer and/or remove a medicinal products), the
notified body must determine if any of the exemptions provided for in
Article 54.2 are applicable. To facilitate this decision-making process,
it would be helpful if manufacturers provide documentation to support
any applicable exemptions (e.g. as applicable a description of all
changes between a legacy device and the MDR-applied device). Whilst not
exhaustive, the following section will discuss the common pitfalls
identified during the notified body assessment of the manufacturer's
clinical evaluation documents.

6.3.1 Clinical Evaluation Strategy Pitfall: The strategy chosen for
clinical evaluation or the rationale for applicability of MDR Article 61
requirements, are not clearly presented in the clinical evaluation
documentation. Guidance: MDR Article 61 describes different options for
clinical evidence to support conformity of the device. The level of
clinical evidence selected by the manufacturer is dependent on several
factors including risk classification of the medical device and its
regulatory status. Based on the clinical evaluation strategy that is
deemed most appropriate and as described in the clinical development
plan, manufacturers have the option to generate and collect clinical
data from a variety of sources including clinical investigations on the
subject device or equivalent device and/or scientific literature and
reports on clinical experience with the subject or equivalent device.
Clinically relevant information derived from Post market surveillance
(PMS) and post market clinical follow up (PMCF) activities can also
provide a source of clinical data. For higher-risk devices (Class III
and Implantable) the requirement is that the clinical evaluation should,
at a minimum, be based on clinical data generated by means of a properly
designed clinical TEAM-NB

investigation(s) performed with the subject device. Exceptions to this
rule are prescribed by Articles 61 (4-6) with further guidance provided
in MDCG 2023-7. For legacy Class III and Implantable devices, the
manufacturer should also consider the guidance provided in MDCG 2020-6
Appendix III when determining sufficiency of clinical evidence and
provide a rationale to justify appropriateness of selected data sources.
Guidance on sufficiency of clinical data for legacy devices is provided
in MDCG 2020-6 and the manufacturer may consider the hierarchy of
clinical evidence presented in Appendix III when justifying the
sufficiency of their evidence. For devices which are new to the market,
the manufacturer must consider the need for a clinical investigation as
part of its clinical development plan and provide a justification if a
pre-market clinical investigation is deemed to be not required. For
devices which intend to leverage clinical data from equivalent devices,
manufacturers should consider the guidance provided in MDCG 2020-5 and
use the provided comparison table template for demonstration of
equivalency. In the case of Class III and Implantable devices which are
intending to rely on equivalence, the manufacturer should refer to MDCG
2023-7 which provides guidance on how to demonstrate sufficient level of
access to the technical documentation of the equivalent device. In the
case of certain class IIa and Class IIb non-implantable devices, it may
not be appropriate to demonstrate conformity based on clinical data. For
these exceptional cases, manufacturers may avail of the clinical data
exemption provided by Article 61.10. In this case the manufacturer must
provide an adequate justification supporting its determination that
clinical data are not appropriate for demonstrating conformity with the
applicable GSPRs. The justification must consider the outputs of the
devices risk management (e.g. residual clinical risks and novelty), the
specifics of the interaction between the device and the human body
including but not limited to consideration of type and duration of
contact, anatomical location, novelty of the interaction etc. The
justification must also consider the intended clinical performance
including whether the device could influence the clinical outcome of a
procedure or treatment, and any claims made by the manufacturer. If
there are any clinical claims, these must be supported by clinical data
rendering article 61 (10) not applicable. It is important that the
manufacturer provides a robust justification with reference to
supporting evidence as this will be a key focus of the notified bodies
assessment. If clinical data are available for similar or equivalent
devices, a clinical evaluation based on the application of article 61
(10) is unlikely to be accepted by the notified body. Further, the
planning of specific PMCF activities in the post market phase is
typically considered to be in direct contradiction to a statement that
the generation of clinical data in the pre-market phase is
inappropriate. Note: Article 61(10) shall not be used for class III
devices and implantable devices or for devices that have insufficient
clinical data (lack or absence of clinical data). Per Article 61.1. the
minimum expectation is that clinical data is required to support safety
and performance requirements. Reliance on non-clinical data alone,
including performance evaluation, bench testing, pre-clinical testing,
usability assessments etc., is for exceptional cases only where there
are no clinically relevant endpoints to measure in the intended patient
population and sole reliance on pre-clinical data including bench
testing is justified to be valid to predict the clinical performance and
safety of device use.

In the case of devices that do not provide a direct clinical benefit,
manufacturers should consider the role of the device in the overall
procedure and its criticality to procedural success, when determining
the applicability of Article 61.10. For example, clinical data may not
be considered appropriate for lowrisk generic surgical instruments such
as scalpels and forceps. However, if a surgical instrument is designed
to be used with a specific implantable device, for example, it may be
more appropriate to leverage indirect clinical data from the implant to
demonstrate that the instrument does not have a negative
influence/impact on the clinical outcomes (Refer to MDCG 2020-6 Section
1.1 and section 6.5a for further guidance).

6.3.2 Clinical Evaluation Plan (CEP) Annex XIV Part A specifies the
elements that must be included in the clinical evaluation plan.
Manufacturers must ensure that all requirements specified in Annex XIV
Part A are clearly addressed, otherwise they can expect to be challenged
by the notified body. Note: A legacy device may have a clinical
evaluation plan that is different to a new device under MDR. MDCG 2020-6
Appendix II describes the expected content of a legacy device clinical
evaluation plan. Whilst not explicitly stated in MDCG 2020-6, a clinical
development plan is required for legacy devices, however as discussed
later in this document, the level of detail will differ to that of a new
medical device. Note: For Orphan devices, manufacturers should consider
the specific aspects detailed in MDCG 202410 Section 7.1 when developing
the CEP. The following are the common pitfalls identified by the
notified body when assessing the CEP: a) General safety and performance
requirements (Annex XIV Part A, 1a -- first indent) Pitfall: GSPRs
requiring clinical data are not identified or incomplete, and/or do not
align with those identified in other parts of the technical
documentation. Example: The sufficient accuracy, precision and stability
of a device with measuring function is supported by clinical evidence
from a clinical study, but GSPR 15.1 is not mentioned in the CEP.
Guidance: The manufacturer should ensure that references to GSPRs which
require supporting clinical data are aligned across the technical
documentation. According to MDR Article 61(1), at least GSPR 1 and 8 are
required, but exceptions may apply in case of a performance-based
evaluation according to MDR Art. 61(10) without clinical data. Other
GSPRs which typically require clinical data include GSPR 5 and 6,
however the manufacturers should consider the relevance of all Annex I
GSPRs within the context of the characteristics of the specific medical
device. b) Intended purpose and Indications (Annex XIV Part A, 1a-
second and third indent) Pitfall: Intended purpose is vague or
incomplete and the documentation does not clearly differentiate between
the intended purpose and the indications. TEAM-NB

Team-NB-PositionPaper-BPG-TechnicalDocEU-MDR-2017-745-V3-20250409.docx

Page 54/79

Team-NB Position Paper The European Association of Medical devices
Notified Bodies

Guidance: A clear, unambiguous and specific intended purpose which
fulfils the definition in MDR Article 2(12) must be provided. As the
intended purpose is critical for accurately determining that the device
is a medical device and further the devices risk classification and
clinical data requirements, it is subject to scrutiny by the notified
and will be challenged if vague or incomplete. The CEP should clearly
differentiate between the indications and the intended purpose. In the
absence of a MDR definition, manufacturers are directed to MDCG 2020-6
which defines indications as "the clinical condition that is to be
diagnosed, prevented, monitored, treated, alleviated, compensated for,
replaced, modified or controlled by the medical device. It should be
distinguished from 'intended purpose/intended use', which describes the
effect of a device". If the device does not have a specific indication
(or contraindications), a justification should be provided. Pitfall:
Lack of consistency in the intended purpose and indications for use
across the device's technical documentation. Guidance: Manufacturers are
advised to cross check the intended purpose statement and indications
for use for alignment across the technical documentation prior to
submission, during the review as applicable, and in the final approved
version. c) Clinical Benefits (Annex XIV Part A, 1a- fourth and sixth
indent) Pitfall: The clinical benefit (role of the device in improving
the health of the patient or patient management or public health) is not
clearly described Guidance: Accurately defining the clinical benefit is
an important starting point in the clinical evaluation process as the
MDR requires the manufacture to demonstrate that the benefits associated
with use of the device outweigh the potential risks to patient safety.
When defining the clinical benefits, the manufacturer should consider
the role of the device in the diagnosis, monitoring, prevention,
treatment, alleviation etc. of a disease, injury or disability and the
subsequent positive impact. For software devices, the role of the
software in the overall clinical workflow should be carefully
considered. Dependent on the clinical performance of the device, the
clinical benefits may be direct or indirect. Indirect clinical benefits
are typically associated with devices which enable a procedure to be
performed, or a therapy to be delivered or they may enable another
device to achieve its intended purpose. In these cases, whilst the
device itself may not have a direct positive impact, the manufacturer
should consider if the devices performance will influence the clinical
outcome of the patient/procedural success. Typically, direct clinical
benefits must be supported by clinical data pertaining to the device
itself or another equivalent device, whereas for indirect clinical
benefits, the manufacturer may choose to rely on evidence sources such
as pre-clinical data or clinical data pertaining to another device which
does have a direct clinical benefit and is used together with the device
under evaluation. A suitable rationale must always be provided for
appropriateness of the selected data source. For further information,
refer to MDCG 2020-6 Section 6.5 and MEDDEV 2.7/1 Rev 4.

Pitfall: The CEP does not clearly provide an indicative list and
specification of parameters to be used to determine, based on the state
of the art in medicine, the acceptability of the benefit-risk ratio for
the various indications and for the intended purpose or purposes of the
device. Guidance: To determine acceptability of the benefit-to-risk
ratio of the device, performance and safety outcomes, the methods used
(e.g. objective clinical tests, validated PROMs questionnaires, etc..),
and the acceptance criteria must be defined based on state of the art,
including product-specific standards if available. The goal is to
demonstrate that by meeting the pre-defined acceptance criteria for each
performance and safety outcome, and considering the overall relation of
benefit to risk, the device under evaluation is a clinically acceptable
option for patients in the light of any other currently available
alternatives. Notably, cost considerations, reimbursement, efficiency in
health care and similar objectives are only a target for the clinical
evaluation under the MDR if they are directly related to clinical
benefits for patients (e.g. enabling faster diagnostic pathways may have
clinical benefits in the emergency situation, e.g. in acute stroke
("time is brain"), but facilitating higher patient throughput to save
costs in elective hospital situations is not a clinical benefit in the
MDR definition). Note: The acceptance criteria (or thresholds) are
usually defined in the CEP, however this is not explicitly stated in the
MDR; thus, it may also be acceptable to define these acceptance criteria
in the CER. Note: Depending on the intended purpose, especially for some
low-risk devices, it may be difficult to determine quantitative
acceptance thresholds for performance and safety. For example, a digital
healthcare software application for mobile phones that allows the
communication between a patient and a physician may have only indirect
clinical benefits like a positive medical supply effect (ensuring
structural and process improvements - See article „Digital Health and
Digital Treatments: The New Reality" by Imre M, Linke J, Gernert D.
Published in PM QM 2020, 22. 3, November), with the outcome parameters
e.g., that a patient is informed and can participate through the
respective application, which leads to detection or monitoring of a
disease or side effects during a specific treatment. Parameters to
determine performance and safety based on the SOTA (if a reliable SOTA
is available for such a device at all) may include a high rate of
patient adherence to the device and a low imbalance rate between the
electronically submitted findings and the clinical findings upon direct
patient contact. d) Specification of methods and parameters (Annex XIV
Part A, 1a- fifth indent) Pitfall: The CEP does not clearly specify the
methods to be used for examination of qualitative and quantitative
aspects of clinical safety with clear reference to the determination of
residual risks and side-effects Guidance: This requirement is asking the
manufacturer to describe the methods that will be used to collect
information and data for the purposes of identifying clinical risks,
side-effects and residual risks associated with use of the device (for
example: literature search, clinical trial data, PMS data, PMCF
activities, risk management), and to specify how the data will be
analysed both qualitatively and quantitatively (for example: the
manufacturer may choose to adopt descriptive and inferential statistics
to determine safety). e) Clinical Development Plan (CDP) (Annex XIV Part
A, 1a- final indent) TEAM-NB

Pitfall: The manufacturer does not provide a CDP for legacy devices.
Guidance: For new medical devices a CDP describing the progression from
exploratory investigations through to confirmatory investigations is
expected. However considering the regulatory status of legacy devices,
this level of detail is not expected and rather the CDP may focus on the
strategy to obtain clinical evidence in line with MDR Article 61
requirements, and the planned PMCF activities. If applicable, the CDP
should also include a justification for any deficiencies in relation to
previously conducted first-in-man studies, feasibility and pilot
studies, confirmatory investigations, such as pivotal clinical
investigations, noting any reference to PMCF activities that are ongoing
or reference to the PMCF Plan as described in Annex XIV.

6.3.3 Clinical Evaluation Report (CER) Per Article 61 (12): The clinical
evaluation, its results and the clinical evidence derived from it shall
be documented in a clinical evaluation report as referred to in Section
4 of Annex XIV, which, except for custom-made devices, shall be part of
the technical documentation referred to in Annex II relating to the
device concerned. Note: A Clinical Evaluation Report is always required
for the device , including devices where the clinical evaluation is
based solely on non-clinical data. The Clinical Evaluation Report should
be written in a clear and structured manner and contain sufficient
information to enable an independent body (e.g. Competent authorities
responsible for notified bodies or the notified body itself) to read and
understand the document. The following information should be provided at
a minimum:

TEAM-NB

•

Clear and comprehensive description of the device under evaluation
including all relevant particulars (e.g. all device models/variants,
description of the technical and clinical differences between the
models/variants, a description of the clinical purpose of design
characteristics, if any accessories are required to use the device, if
the device is part of a system/ procedure pack, how the device is used
in the context of the clinical diagnostic/treatment pathway, the use
environment, etc....).. The description should be sufficiently detailed
to facilitate ease of understanding by persons not directly involved in
the design, development and manufacturer of the device. For guidance
refer to MEDDEV 2.7/1 Rev 4 Appendix 3. For devices which require
consultation with the CECP as per Annex IX.5.1/Article 54, the
description is expected to be part of the CER. For other devices, a
clear reference to existing documents in the TD, such as the CEP, may be
sufficient.

•

Specification of the frequency of clinical evaluation updates and
provision of this rationale.

•

CVs and Declaration of Interests of all individuals conducting /
approving the clinical evaluation and ensure these are appropriate for
the device under evaluation (e.g. including an end user of the device,
e.g. medical professional).

•

The literature search protocol, the literature search report, the list
of databases used, and a copy of all literature articles selected and
analysed within the clinical evaluation report, ensuring these have been
performed within appropriate timelines.

•

The literature searches should include a state-of-the-art literature
identifying benchmark/similar devices and where appropriate other
treatment/diagnostic alternatives. This data should form part of the
performance and safety objectives for the device under evaluation.

•

A second literature search should be conducted on the device under
evaluation (or claimed equivalent) when the device has been previously
marketed. The intention of this search is to identify any favourable or
unfavourable clinical data that the manufacturer does not hold.

•

A third literature search may be required to identify any pre-clinical
aspects, particularly where there are unanswered questions from the
clinical evaluation that can be supported by pre-clinical data and
scientific evidence.

If clinical investigations have been performed, the following
documentation is required: •

Clinical investigation plan(s), including any amendments. A summary of
the sequence of amendments, and their approval by the competent
authorities may be helpful in complex investigations. For guidance refer
to MDCG 2024-3. For orphan devices, manufacturers should consider the
specific considerations detailed in MDCG 2024-10 Appendix A2 when
planning a clinical investigation

•

Completed clinical investigation report, signed by the principal
investigator(s).

•

Evidence of communication and no objections with the ethics committee.

investigations relevant to your devices with endpoints related to safety
or performance claims; study locations that were used in the pre-market
clinical investigation are identified. When clinical investigations are
conducted outside the EU: provide an analysis whether results are
transferable to the European population, consider the relevance of EN
ISO 14155 and whether the results are publicly available. Statistical
Analysis Plans (SAPs) - a clear description must be provided of the
statistical tools, techniques, analyses used in the design and conduct
of clinical investigations, and analysis of clinical data within the
overall clinical evaluation. The rationale if clinical investigation has
not been performed for Class III and implantable devices per Article 61
(7). For guidance refer to MDCG 2023-7. Information on public
registration in EUDAMED of clinical investigations conducted. In the
absence of EUDAMED, refer to MDCG 2021-1. With respect to Regulation
(EU) 2017/745, including EUDAMED single registration number, when
available, or a rationale if clinical investigations are not performed
under Regulation (EU) 2017/745 and are not publicly registered or
published. Please include information about registration in any other
public study register. If the study has not been registered, please
provide justification. All Competent/Regulatory Authority correspondence
(from all countries, including outside of EU). If the clinical
evaluation of the device relies on a justification of equivalence of
comparative devices: detailed demonstration of equivalence regarding
technical, biological and clinical characteristics and information on
all differences between it and the comparable devices relative to
intended use, technical, or biological factors in accordance with MDR
Annex XIV Part A (3) and MDCG 2020-5. Justifications for allowable
differences should be presented with scientific evidence and this
evidence should be provided separately. For Class III and implantable
devices: in case of applicability of MDR Article 61(5), a copy of the
signed contract between the two manufacturers that explicitly allows
full access to the equivalent marketed device's technical documentation
on an ongoing basis should be provided and evidence that the equivalent
device is MDR certified. In the other cases, as per MDCG 2023-7, please
provide evidence for the sufficient level of access to device
equivalence data. For devices incorporating medicinal substances/
non-viable tissues / cells from animal or human origin, a conclusion on
the risk/ benefit of adding the ancillary substance to the device should
be included. If the device covers multiple strengths or indications,
this should cover all variants. Note: MEDDEV 2.7/1 Rev. 4 Section A9
'Clinical evaluation report - proposed table of contents, examples of
contents' provide a helpful layout on the expectations of the content of
a clinical evaluation report.

Note: For Orphan devices, manufacturers should consider the specific
aspects detailed in MDCG 202410 Appendix A1 when generating the CER.
Whilst not an exhaustive list, the following are the common pitfalls
identified by the notified body when assessing the CER: a) Frequency of
Updates Pitfall: The frequency for updating the clinical evaluation is
not defined or the rationale for supporting the defined frequency does
not consider all relevant and foreseeable circumstances that could
trigger an update. Per MDR Article 62 (11): The clinical evaluation and
its documentation shall be updated throughout the life cycle of the
device concerned with clinical data obtained from the implementation of
the manufacturer\'s PMCF plan in accordance with Part B of Annex XIV and
the post-market surveillance plan referred to in Article 84. Guidance:
The clinical evaluation must be updated throughout the life cycle of the
device with clinical data from the PMS and PMCF processes, however there
is no defined update schedule requirement in the regulation. The
expectation is that manufacturers align the frequency of clinical
evaluation updates with the guidance currently available from MEDDEV
2.7/1 Rev 4.0. Based on this guidance the clinical evaluation should be
updated at a minimum: ▪ ▪ ▪ ▪

When the manufacturer receives PMS including PMCF information with
potential to change the current evaluation. at least annually if the
device carries significant risks or is not yet well established. every 2
to 5 years if the device is not expected to carry significant risks and
is well established, For Class III and Implantable devices: an annual
update should be considered.

The manufacturer is expected to justify the defined frequency for
performing periodic updates of the clinical evaluation, considering
factors such as: ▪ ▪ ▪ ▪ ▪ ▪ ▪

TEAM-NB

Whether the device carries significant risks. The likeliness of the new
information becoming available on the device or state of the art.
Whether there are risks and uncertainties or unanswered questions, in
the medium or longterm, that would influence the frequency of updates.
Whether design changes or changes to manufacturing procedures have been
made (if any) which could impact the safety and/or performance of the
device. Whether significant changes to the state of the art have
occurred which may affect the benefit-risk conclusion of the device.
Whether significant new or unanticipated device risks have been
identified through the postmarket surveillance. Whether design or
manufacturing changes have been made.

b\) Defining State of the Art (SOTA) Pitfall: The state of the art is
not clearly defined and/or is incomplete and it is not clear how the
acceptance criteria for each safety and performance outcome have been
established based on SOTA. Guidance: Evaluation of the device within the
context of the state of the art is essential for demonstrating that when
used as intended, the benefits outweigh any potential safety risks. As a
starting point to this analysis, manufacturers must define the SOTA for
their device. A comprehensive analysis of the SOTA is critical as it
facilitates characterisation of the expected clinical performance (and
the resulting clinical benefit), and the clinical safety profile for the
device under evaluation. SOTA is not defined by the regulation however
other sources provide guidance to develop a harmonised understanding: ▪

▪

Per IMDRF/GRRP WG/N47: Developed stage of current technical capability
and/or accepted clinical practice in regard to products, processes and
patient management, based on the relevant consolidated findings of
science, technology and experience Per MDCG 2020-6: The state-of-the-art
embodies what is currently and generally accepted as good practice in
technology and medicine. The state-of-the-art does not necessarily imply
the most technologically advanced solution.

Considering these definitions, it is generally accepted that defining
SOTA within the CER involves describing the medical field, including
best clinical practices e.g. based on guidelines issued by medical
expert societies, within which the device under evaluation is intended
to operate. The medical field includes the clinical condition including
its epidemiology and natural progression, that is intended to be
treated, managed, diagnosed etc. by the device. Discussion of currently
available alternative treatment options (including conservative,
surgical, medicinal) should be addressed, considering the
appropriateness of patient selection criteria/ targets groups as an
input for the intended use specification. In addition, similar and
benchmark devices should be identified and a discussion of their safety
and performance profile provided. When defining SOTA, the manufacturer
must ensure coverage of the full intended purpose. The manufacturer must
describe and evaluate the degree of novelty of the device, in the light
of the current SOTA and consider novelty in the specification of the
sufficient level of evidence. It is expected that a comprehensive SOTA
analysis will lead to the identification of the safety and performance
objectives and acceptance criteria which will be used to compare the
device with similar/benchmark devices and other alternative treatments,
in accordance with MDR Annex XIV Part A, 1a indent #6. The purpose of
this comparison is to demonstrate an acceptable benefit-to-safety
profile of the device under evaluation considering existing products or
therapies. Alternatively, the outcome of the SOTA analysis may
demonstrate an unmet clinical need, for which the device under
evaluation is intended to address.

Clinical data and if appropriate non-clinical data, will be used by the
manufacturer to demonstrate achievement of the performance and safety
acceptance criteria and demonstration that the benefit of the device
outweighs the risks. In summary, the two most relevant outputs of the
SOTA review are: •

the identification of alternative treatment options, and

• the identification of relevant performance and safety outcome
parameters together with their acceptable ranges for similar devices and
alternative treatment options. These acceptance thresholds as identified
in the SOTA should be fed into the CEP during the planning phase (see
section CEP above) and be compared to the available device-specific
(clinical) data in order to conclude about the acceptability of the
benefit-risk ratio for the device under assessment.

c\) Sufficient Clinical Evidence Pitfall: Sufficient clinical evidence
to support the applicable annex I GSPRs (specifically to support the
claimed intended purpose) and any clinical claims made within the
technical documentation including the labelling, instructions for use,
any promotional or marketing materials is not provided by the
manufacturer. MDR Article 2(51) defines clinical evidence as: clinical
data and clinical evaluation results pertaining to a device of a
sufficient amount and quality to allow a qualified assessment of whether
the device is safe and achieves the intended clinical benefit(s), when
used as intended by the manufacturer. Guidance: Clinical data providing
sufficient evidence is required to demonstrate that a medical device is
safe for use, performs as intended and that the benefits outweigh any
potential residual risks. Sufficient clinical evidence relates to the
quantity and quality (e.g. completeness, scientific validity,
reliability) of clinical data that is needed to support conformity. It
is up to the manufacturer to specify and justify within the clinical
evaluation plan or report, what types of clinical data are required and
why the resulting clinical evidence is sufficient. The role of the
notified body is to verify that, in view of the characteristics of the
device and its intended purpose, the conclusions presented in the
clinical evaluation are robust and fully supported by sufficient
clinical evidence. It should be noted that there are several factors
that influence the regulatory expectations for providing high quality
clinical data, such as risk classification of the device, novelty,
safety concerns relating to the device family on the market, market
history (new vs. legacy device), etc. Per MDR Art. 61(1): The level of
clinical evidence shall be appropriate in view of the characteristics of
the device and its intended purpose. As part of their assessment, the
notified body will look for evidence that the manufacturer has applied a
scientific and logical approach to determining the sufficiency of their
clinical evidence. In accordance with MEDDEV 2.7/1 Rev 4.0, recommended
steps are as follows: Step 1: Identify Clinical Data TEAM-NB

Clinical data refers to any safety or performance related
data/information generated from use of the subject device and/or an
equivalent device in the intended patient population per the
manufacturers intended use. For further guidance including sources of
clinical data, refer to MEDDEV 2.7/1 Rev 4.0, Section 8.0 identification
of Pertinent Data and MDCG 2020-6 Section 6.2. Note: If the clinical
evaluation covers multiple device models/variants, manufacturers should
consider stratifying their data for ease of interpretation and review by
the notified body. Note: If the manufacturer intends to use clinical
data that is generated outside of the EU, they must demonstrate that the
resulting data can be extrapolated to the target EU population --
consideration should be given to relevant differences in clinical
practices, surgical procedures, differences in the epidemiology of
target disease, physiological and genetic differences between regions
and their ethnicities, appropriateness of model training and validation
data in AI based devices, etc. Note: For Orphan indications,
manufacturers should consider the guidance provided on clinical data
extrapolation in MDCG 2024-10 Appendix A3. Note: For medical device
software, MDCG 2020-1 describes three key components that must be
considered when compiling clinical evidence: Valid Clinical
Association/Scientific Validity, Technical performance/Analytical
performance, and Clinical performance. Note: The notified body
assessment of the literature search protocol typically focuses on (1)
Search databases selected and justification for use, (2) Search method
to be applied e.g. PICO, PRISMA etc., (3) Search terms -- coverage of
the intended purpose and all indications, (4) Search date and
justification for search date ranges, (5) Inclusion and exclusion
criteria and rationale for their use, (6) Process for identifying
information from other sources such as internet searches for unpublished
information, (7) Approaches taken to identify best practice industry and
medical practices/guidelines and (8) Data collection plan to ensure
reliability and completeness of results, including the identification of
duplicate data. For further guidance refer to MEDDEV 2.7/1 Rev 4.0,
Appendix A4 and A5. Note: The notified body assessment of a clinical
investigations typically focuses on (1) Ethics and competent authority
approval (2) Study design, including the adherence to acknowledged
principles of good clinical practice (e.g. EN ISO 14155) (3) Study
locations, (4) Patient population including the in-/exclusion criteria
in the light of the target groups specified in the IFU (5) Patient
numbers -- this number should be statistically justified, (6) Objectives
and Endpoints (7) Appropriateness of length of follow up and intervals,
in particular in implantable and long-term invasive devices, (8) the
efficacy results and how they support the clinical evaluation, (9) the
safety results and how they align with the risk management of the
manufacturer. Notably, any device deficiencies observed in the study are
expected to be evaluated as part of the CER. (10) any deviations from
the study protocol and how they have been considered, (11) any remaining
open scientific questions and how they have been considered for setting
up the PMCF plan. Note: If the manufacturer intends to support certain
aspects of the intended purpose based on clinical data generated from
the use of the device in other uses (for example leveraging clinical
data pertaining to adult patients to adolescents or children), a
detailed justification must be provided demonstrating

the relevance of the clinical data to the specific intended purpose
aspect (e.g. patient sub-populations, device variants etc.). Step 2:
Appraise Clinical Data Manufacturer must provide evidence that they have
appraised the clinical data derived from peer reviewed scientific
literature and any other relevant reports or publications. Data
appraisal requires consideration of at the least the following elements:
▪ ▪ ▪ ▪ ▪

Relevance to the device under evaluation or the equivalent device (if
applicable), (Refer to MEDDEV 2.7/1 Rev 4.0, Section 9.3.2). Scientific
validity and reliability (Refer to MEDDEV 2.7/1 Rev 4.0, Section 9.3.1
and Appendix A6). Coverage of the target patient population covered by
the intended purpose and all indications. Coverage of the device
variants included in the clinical evaluation. Clinical claims made by
the manufacturer.

Ultimately the goal of data appraisal is to identify datasets that
provide the strongest evidence to support the manufacturers conclusions
regarding device safety and performance. For guidance refer to MEDDEV
2.7/1 Rev 4.0, Section 9.0 and Appendix 6 and MDCG 2020-6 Section 6.3.
Step 3: Analyse Clinical Data The final step is to analyse the appraised
datasets and determine if collectively and within the context of the
SOTA, they provide sufficient evidence, to demonstrate that, for the
duration of its lifetime: ▪ ▪

the expected clinical benefit of device use has been demonstrated and
does not cause unacceptable levels of harm to the users or patients,
when weighed against the clinical benefits.

The notified body will look for evidence that the manufacturer has
completed a comprehensive analysis of the appraised data including
consideration of all datasets which provide unfavourable results and
that the analysed data supports the manufacturers conclusion regarding
conformity to the applicable GSPRs. Consistency in performance and
safety outcomes across different datasets provides greater confidence in
the reliability and validity of the data. However, if different results
are identified across the datasets or there is a particular outlier
dataset, the manufacturer should discuss these differences and if
possible, explain the reasoning behind them. If a decision is made that
a specific dataset does not add value to the evaluation, a rationale
should be provided. Based on this analysis, the manufacturer should
conclude: ▪

variants covered by the clinical evaluation.

o

▪ ▪

▪

The manufacturer should also consider the minimum level of clinical data
that is needed based on the regulatory requirements of Article 61. For
example, Class III and Implantable devices require clinical data
generated from a pre-market clinical investigations unless the
manufacturer can avail of any of the exemptions provided for in Article
6 (4-6). o For legacy devices, manufacturers should refer to the
guidance provided in MDCG 2020-6 Appendix III and may consider applying
the hierarchy of clinical data types to their device. o As part of the
assessment, the notified body must verify adequacy of the evidence to
support any claims that are made by the manufacturer. To facilitate this
verification, tabulation of the clinical and non-clinical claims within
the CER including a clear reference to the data which supports each
claim is advised. If there is a need to conduct pre-market clinical
investigation or other studies to address any identified gaps in the
data. If specific Post Market Clinical Follow Up activities are required
to generate real world data to further support safety and performance
outcomes (e.g. long term follow up post implantation, data on rare
indications, rare populations, rare complications, address any
uncertainties etc.). If there is a need to narrow the intended purpose
and claims due to lack of sufficient supporting evidence.

For guidance refer to MEDDEV 2.7/1 Rev 4.0, Sections 10 and 11 and
Appendix 6 and MDCG 2020-6 Section 6.5 and Appendix III. d) Benefit-Risk
Analysis Pitfall: Conclusions regarding acceptability of the benefit to
risk ratio do not consider all available data. Guidance: The clinical
benefit refers to the positive impact of the device on the health of the
patient expressed in terms of a meaningful, measurable, patient-relevant
clinical outcome(s), or positive impact on patient management or the
public health. It is acknowledged that the clinical benefit can be
achieved directly by the medical device or indirectly whereby the device
itself does not directly achieve a positive impact but may influence the
clinical outcome of the patient. The risks refer to the residual
clinical related harms which have the potential to negatively impact on
patient health. The expected clinical benefits and clinical risks should
be identified as part of the SOTA analysis, and the clinical risks
including likelihood of occurrence and mitigations, considered via the
devices risk management. In the CER, a clear description of the benefits
and the key clinical risks including actions taken to reduce them to an
acceptable level should be provided. This information is expected to be
traceable to and aligned with the records in the risk management file.
E.g., for a clinical risk described to be mitigated by information for
safety in the IFU in the CER, a related line in a FMEA provided in the
risk management file, systematically evaluating this risk and the
effective implementation, is expected. Considering all the available
data, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the benefits of using the
device outweigh the risks for all medical conditions and target
populations covered by the intended purpose, and for all device
variants. This may be achieved through comparison of the performance
TEAM-NB

Team-NB-PositionPaper-BPG-TechnicalDocEU-MDR-2017-745-V3-20250409.docx

Notified Bodies

and safety profile of the device with the currently available treatment
options, alternative therapy options, benchmark and similar devices,
identified as an outcome of the State-of-the-Art analysis. Three
possibly acceptable scenarios may be detected: (1.) performance and
safety for the device under evaluation are comparable with or
outperforming the current SOTA. (2.) performance is lower than SOTA, but
also the risks are reduced compared to SOTA to a level that justifies
the lower performance. (3.) risk are higher than SOTA, but also the
performance is higher than the current SOTA in a way that justifies
higher risks. At some point, a mathematical counterbalancing of what
kind of benefits justify what kind of risks will not be possible anymore
but rather must be assessed based on the clinical expertise of the
evaluators. e) Device Lifetime Pitfall: The lifetime of the medical
device is not defined or is claimed to be indefinite or undefined.
Guidance: Manufacturers must define the lifetime or expected lifetime or
expected service life for the medical device. The lifetime can be
specified in terms of minutes/days/years/months or other appropriate
quantitative terms such as number of uses etc. or relative terms such as
e.g. time to next update for a software, etc. In case of implants, which
are not intended to be removed, the lifetime of the device is equal to
the remaining lifetime of the patient after implantation. This fact must
be duly considered in the evaluation of risks, with a view of the
earliest age at which the patient may receive the implant (e.g. device
for adults: 18 years) versus the life expectancy in the target market. A
clear specification of the device lifetime enables the notified body
assessor to ensure that the clinical data and/or PMCF plan is
appropriate to meet the requirements of Annex XIV. For further guidance
refer to Team NB Position Paper on Medical Device Lifetime.

6.3.4 Post Market Clinical Follow-Up (PMCF) Plan and Evaluation Report
Per Article 61 (11): The clinical evaluation and its documentation shall
be updated throughout the life cycle of the device concerned with
clinical data obtained from the implementation of the manufacturer\'s
PMCF plan in accordance with Part B of Annex XIV and the post-market
surveillance plan referred to in Article 84. For class III devices and
implantable devices, the PMCF evaluation report and, if indicated, the
summary of safety and clinical performance referred to in Article 32
shall be updated at least annually with such data. PMCF is a continuous
process that is used to proactively collect and evaluate clinical data
generated from actual use of the CE marked device in the target
population per the approved intended purpose TEAM-NB

Team-NB-PositionPaper-BPG-TechnicalDocEU-MDR-2017-745-V3-20250409.docx

Page 66/79

Team-NB Position Paper The European Association of Medical devices
Notified Bodies

and in accordance with a predefined plan. In accordance with MDR Annex
XIV Part 6.1, the purpose of PMCF is to confirm the safety, performance
and continued acceptability of benefit to risk for the duration of the
devices expected lifetime, detect any new/emerging risks and to identify
possible systematic misuse or off-label use of the device, with a view
to verifying that the intended purpose is correct. The data and
information generated from implementation of the PMCF plan, is fed back
into and updates the devices clinical evaluation and risk management.
This is an important step in the process as it allows the manufacturer
to continuously evaluate their device within the context of the current
SOTA and safety and performance profile of benchmark/similar devices.
The common pitfalls identified by the notify body during the assessment
of the PMCF plan and report are as follows: a) PMCF Plan and Report
content Pitfall: The PMCF plan does not include all elements required by
Annex XIV Part B. Guidance: MDCG 2020-7 has been developed to assist
manufacturers demonstrate compliance with the regulatory requirements
for developing a PMCF plan (MDR Annex XIV Part B, Section 6.2). Whilst
not mandatory, it is highly recommended that manufacturers follow this
guidance when generating the PMCF plan for their device and provide as
much detail as possible to facilitate verification by the notified body.
Manufacturers should avoid generic PMCF plans. Rather it should be clear
to the notified body how the findings and conclusions from the devices
clinical evaluation have been considered in the establishment of the
proposed PMCF Plan. It should be noted that per MDR Annex XIV 6.2, PMCF
is not exclusively related to clinical studies. If the manufacturer
determines that PMCF clinical studies are not required, a PMCF plan is
still required, as the manufacturer is expected to at least perform
general PMCF methods. If the manufacturer determines that specific
activities such as studies or surveys are required, the plan should
clearly indicate their timings/durations and relevant endpoints in
respect of the SOTA. It is also important to confirm the quality and
quantity of evidence that will be generated from the activity. If
appropriate, the manufacturer may refer to supporting documentation such
as study/survey protocols in the PMCF plan, however these documents
cannot be submitted in place of the PMCF plan. The PMCF plan can be
generated as a stand-alone document or incorporated as part of the PMS
plan. Irrespective of the approach taken, the manufacturer is
responsible for demonstrating how each requirement of Annex XIV Part B
6.2 has been addressed. Pitfall: The PMCF report in incomplete and lacks
details on status of activities. Guidance: MDCG 2020-8 has been
developed to assist manufacturers demonstrate compliance with the
regulatory requirements for generating the PMCF evaluation report. It
must be clear from the report if specific PMCF activities are on track
or if there have been any variations from plan. The report should also
clearly state the reporting period and whether the data presented in
historical or newly generated during the reporting period. Evidence of
off-label use should be clearly documented and TEAM-NB

Team-NB-PositionPaper-BPG-TechnicalDocEU-MDR-2017-745-V3-20250409.docx

Page 67/79

Team-NB Position Paper The European Association of Medical devices
Notified Bodies

discussed with the report and consideration given to the need to update
the clinical evaluation and risk management documentation. Analysis of
the data generated from the PMCF activities should be clearly presented
within the PMCF report and the findings and results discussed in
relation to the specific objectives defined by the PMCF plan and within
the context of the SOTA. The status of the PMCF activities defined in
the PMCF plan should be clearly described in the PMCF report including a
justification for any delays or deviations, including consideration of
the impact if any on achievement of the objectives and whether changes
require notification to and approval by the notified body. Where
activities are ongoing and data is incomplete, specifically for PMCF
studies, it is still expected that some level of analysis will be
undertaken, even if this is limited to an analysis of adverse events,
for example. Where applicable, interim analyses should be provided, as
these provide evidence that activities are progressing appropriately.
The PMCF evaluation report may be generated as a stand-alone document
with appropriate discussion and reference in the CER, or it can be fully
integrated into the CER. Irrespective of the approach taken, the
manufacturer may consider using the outline provided by MDCG 2020-8 when
presenting and discussing the PMCF data. b) General and Specific PMCF
methods Pitfall: The PMCF plan does not clearly differentiate between
general and specific PMCF activities, and/or a justification is not
provided for not performing specific PMCF, when appropriate. Guidance:
MDR Annex XIV Part B 6.2 describes both general and specific methods of
PMCF. General PMCF methods include activities such as literature
reviews, solicited user feedback/focus groups, review of regulatory
device databases and level 8 surveys (based on recall of multiple device
usages). Whereas specific methods refer to activities such as
retrospective/prospective clinical studies, registry studies, other real
world data studies and level 4 high quality surveys (one survey per
patient chart or device use or case). As part of the PMCF plan, the
manufacturer is required to provide a rationale for the appropriateness
of the chosen methods. Note: In the PMCF report general and specific
activities should be discussed and presented separately in terms of
rationale for the activity, sample size, objectives etc. General PMCF
activities are applicable to all types of devices, however, they may be
particularly suited to devices where: ▪

the long-term safety and performance are known, or the device is
considered to be standard of care.

▪

devices have a long history of use on EU market, with no identified
trends or safety concerns and the manufacturer has sufficient (quality
and quantity) clinical data to support their claims.

▪

the risk-benefit ratio is acceptable.

For devices that meet these criteria, specific PMCF activities are
typically not required. Nevertheless, general PMCF activity should still
be planned, have clear objectives and be conducted systematically and a
justification for not performing specific PMCF provided. Specific PMCF
activities are appropriate for devices where uncertainties remain from
the clinical evaluation and additional clinical data is required to
support long term safety and performance of the device or rare
indications or specific target populations or specific device variants
or to address new concerns arising from vigilance, literature and other
PMS data for example. Specific PMCF is usually required when the devices
are: • Novel technologies or have a new or novel intended use. •

Higher-risk device and use scenarios.

•

Devices approved with clinical data from equivalent devices

•

When urgent market access has been granted in public health emergencies.

•

Specific questions may remain open from the clinical evaluation. E.g.
lifetime data for longer term implants.

PMCF studies are conducted to address uncertainties and gaps in clinical
data. This can be due to needing to address unanswered questions of
long-term safety, clinical performance and/or effectiveness or to
address new concerns arising from vigilance, literature and other PMS
data. Registry studies are a means of organised data collection for a
specific type of device. Whilst they can be sponsored by the
manufacturer of the device, they may often be organised at a national
population level, with the aim to improve knowledge of safety and
performance of a device or device type. Registries are based on real
world experience and particularly suited to tracking long term outcomes
and follow up. However, the data collected may be prone to bias, due to
retrospective input of data, burden on inputters and compliance. High
quality surveys -- Level 4 High quality surveys are generally at the
patient level whereby one questionnaire/survey is completed per chart.
The survey should have clearly defined primary and secondary endpoints.
Validating the questionnaire to be used and ensuring the sample size is
statistically calculated is vital. Methods to analyse the data received
should be appropriate to the data gathered. During planning the
manufacturer must consider how many surveys need to be conducted and
received to ensure statistical applicability of any findings. If these
factors are not considered and put into practice, the survey data loses
its quality though may still provide useful information, but it will
unlikely meet requirements of specific PMCF, rather it would be
considered general PMCF.

Note: If specific PMCF activities are not to be conducted in EU
countries a supporting rationale/justification must be provided. Note:
Objectives/endpoints set in the PMCF specific activities should be
consistent with those on the clinical evaluation.

c\) Changes to PMCF Plan Pitfall: Significant changes to PMCF activities
are not communicated to the notified body in advance of implementation.
Guidance: Proposed changes to the PMCF plan should be considered via the
manufacturers change management process to determine the potential
impact on product safety and performance, and on regulatory compliance.
Per the MDR, significant changes require notification to the notified
body for approval prior to implementation. Changes that may be
considered significant include Removal or ceasing of any ongoing or
planned specific activities, Delays or deviations to study
protocol/timelines, Reduction in sample sizes or number of participating
sites, Changes to study objectives or endpoints, Changes to statistical
analysis plan. Typically, administrative changes or changes to general
methods are not considered to be significant.

6.3.5 Summary of Safety and Clinical Performance (SSCP) Report Per
Article 32 of the MDR, all Class III and Implantable devices (excluding
custom made devices) require an SSCP. The content of the SSCP Report
should be aligned to the layout template and guidance provided in MDCG
2019-9 and should consider the following aspects: -

All information provided in the SSCP must be traceable to the technical
documentation.

\-

Please confirm with your notified body the languages preference for
validation of the SSCP.

\-

The SSCP should be in pdf format, printable and searchable and follow
the template provided in MDCG 2019-9.

\-

The SSCP should be updated annually (as per Article 61), if indicated,
over the lifetime of the device as needed, and updates should be defined
in the Post-Market Surveillance Plan.

\-

For Class IIa implantable and Class IIb implantable WET
(Well-Established Technologies) devices, the MDR allows notified bodies
to choose representative devices from each device category or generic
device group, respectively, for the assessment of Technical
Documentation. The SSCPs for such devices chosen as the representative
samples will be validated by the notified body as part of the technical
documentation assessment for those devices. MDCG 2019-9 requires that
notified bodies also upload the unvalidated SSCPs of the devices that
were not chosen as representative

devices (but are part of the same device categories or generic device
groups) to EUDAMED and, therefore, these will need to be provided before
certificate issue. For Class III devices that are intended to be used
directly by a patient or implantable devices that require an implant
card (per article 18) then a patient/layperson version of the SSCP is
always required. For all other devices the availability of a
patient/layperson version SSCP should be considered. If it is still
decided that a patient version/layperson is not applicable, then a
robust justification must be provided. For the patient/layperson version
SSCP ensure: -

Appropriate patient/layperson terminology is used throughout the
document in addition to stylistic recommendations.

\-

Evidence is provided of an appropriate validation technique of the
layperson test.

\-

The layout template and guidance provided for the patient/layperson in
MDCG 2019-9 is applied and the provided example statements have been
considered.

ANNEX III TECHNICAL SURVEILLANCE

DOCUMENTATION

ON

POST-MARKET

7 Post Market Surveillance Per MDR Article 83 (1): For each device,
manufacturers shall plan, establish, document, implement, maintain and
update a post-market surveillance system in a manner that is
proportionate to the risk class and appropriate for the type of device.
That system shall be an integral part of the manufacturer\'s quality
management system referred to in Article 10(9). The PMS system is a
critical component of the manufacturers quality management system (QMS),
as it continuously and systematically generates safety and performance
related data and information from actual use of the medical device from
the market. The data and information are fed back into and used to
update the other QMS processes including but not limited to feedback and
complaint handling, improvement, design and development, risk management
and clinical evaluation. An effective feedback loop between these
processes is essential for demonstrating a full lifecycle approach to
ensuring safety and performance of the device and that the benefits
continue to outweigh the risks for the duration of its lifetime. A PMS
plan which clearly address all requirements listed in Annex III, is
required for all device risk classifications. The data generated from
implementation of the plan must be periodically analysed and the results
and conclusions documented in the Post-Market Surveillance Report for
Class I devices (Article 85) or the Periodic Safety Update Report for
Class IIa, IIb and Class III devices (Article 86). These reports are
subject to scrutiny by the notified body and the competent authority,
and therefore the manufacturer must ensure that they are being updated
and maintained per the frequency defined by the MDR (See Article 85 and
86). Note: In the absence of EUDAMED, refer to MDCG 2021-1 and your
notified body for further guidance on submission arrangements for PSUR
evaluations. Whilst not an exhaustive list, the following are the common
pitfalls identified by the notified body when assessing the
manufacturers PMS documentation.

7.1 Post Market Surveillance Plan Pitfall: The PMS plan is not specific
to a particular type of medical device. Guidance: When establishing the
PMS plan it's important to clearly define the scope of the plan or in
other words clearly what device or if relevant, what category or group
of devices will be covered by the plan. A device is associated with one
Basic UDI-DI and may include different variants or sizes. A category or
group of devices will include multiple Basic UDI-DIs, and a
justification should be provided TEAM-NB

Team-NB-PositionPaper-BPG-TechnicalDocEU-MDR-2017-745-V3-20250409.docx

Team-NB Position Paper The European Association of Medical devices
Notified Bodies

to explain the relevance of grouping the devices together. The residual
risks and market history associated with the device should drive the
objectives of PMS Plan and each planned activity is expected to bring
meaningful data for the specific device type. The planned PMS activities
should be proportionate to the risk associated with the device(s). To
incorporate this concept into the PMS plan, consider the following: -

Develop the plan based on residual risks identified from the clinical
evaluation.

\-

Link PMS activities to risks identified in the risk management file and
clearly outline how data collection addresses specific risks.

\-

The plan should provide a justification for why certain risks do not
require additional PMS activities.

Note: Manufacturers may refer to ISO/TR 20416:2020 Medical Devices --
Post market surveillance for manufacturers, for additional guidance on
scoping the PMS plan.

Pitfall: The level of information provided in the PMS plan lacks detail
and is incomplete. Guidance: The PMS plan must clearly and
comprehensively address each of the requirements prescribed by Annex III
1.1(b). Any missing or poorly described requirements will be challenged
by the notified body. The PMS information that must be generated from
the PMS system is described by Annex III 1.1 (a). This information can
be derived from reactive or proactive data sources. Reactive is
considered as a passive activity whereby the manufacturer waits for the
information to be provided to them before assessing and if necessary,
taking corrective action. A typical example is complaints, whereby the
manufacturer finds out that there has been an issue after the fact, when
they are notified by a customer or representative. Proactive is
considered as an active approach, whereby the manufacturer goes out to
the market and actively seeks performance and safety related data for
the purposes of identifying and mitigating potential issues before they
can occur and cause harm. An example of different reactive and proactive
data sources is presented below:

Reactive Data Sources ▪ Complaint and vigilance data analysis ▪ Serious
and non-serious incidents ▪ Service reports / Maintenance reports ▪
Feedback/Observations from the sales and marketing teams (e.g. social
media, online patient forums, customer meetings etc.) ▪ Screening of
scientific literature to identify device specific events ▪ Notified body
communications/feedback ▪ Corrective actions (CAPA System)

Proactive Data Sources General PMCF Methods: ▪ Level 8 Surveys ▪
Feedback / Interviews (Users, distributors, importers) ▪ Screening of
scientific literature to identify new data and information. For example,
in the case of similar or equivalent medical devices ▪ Publicly
available information about similar medical device Specific PMCF
Methods: ▪ Level 4 Surveys ▪ Medical device registries ▪ PMCF study
(retrospective or prospective)

Considering the scope and objectives of the PMS plan, the manufacturer
should consider the following when developing their device specific PMS
plan: ➢ Data collection o What data sources are you planning to use and
why are these data sources suitable for the device. o How will you
collect the data and who is responsible. o When will the data be
collected and how much do you need (e.g. sample size). o Note: Notified
bodies will look for evidence that the manufacturer has carefully
considered which information is relevant to the specific device covered
by the plan. o Note: Consideration should be given to ensuring that the
data needed to generate the PSUR is collected (Refer to MDCG 2022-21). ➢
Data Analysis o How will you analyse the collected data (For example:
Qualitative or quantitative (statistical), descriptive, transcription,
codification etc.). o What type of data analysis is required to allow
for comparison of the subject device to similar products available on
the market. o Who is responsible for analysing the collected data and
when will this analysis occur. o What methods and tools will be used to
investigate complaints and analyse marketrelated experience collected in
the field. o How will you differentiate between serious and non-serious
incidents and what will you do if a serious incident is identified. o
How will you determine if there is a trend or statistically significant
increase in the frequency or severity of non-serious incidents or
expected undesirable side effects (MDR Article 88). ➢ Acceptance
Criteria o What indicators/thresholds and associated acceptance criteria
will be used to identify the need to trigger an action including
reassessment of the benefit to risk.

o

Are these indicators/thresholds appropriate to the device covered by the
PMS plan considering the SOTA. ➢ Link to other QMS processes o If a
corrective action or field safety corrective action is needed, how will
this be triggered and managed. o How will you ensure that you can
identify and trace any devices that require corrective actions. o What
is the method for communicating with competent authorities, notified
bodies, economic operators and users, as required. o What
processes/procedures/methods are in place to ensure that relevant data
and information is fed back into the relevant QMS processes such as
design and development, risk management and clinical evaluation. ➢
Reporting o What processes/procedures/methods are in place to ensure
that results of the analysed data and conclusion are available to
generate the PMSR or PSUR per the defined schedule for generating these
reports. o Note: Consider how the data is to be presented (Refer to MDCG
2022-21, Annex II). Note: Manufacturers may refer to ISO/TR 20416:2020
Medical Devices -- Post market surveillance for manufacturers, for
additional guidance. Note: Manufacturers may refer to other QMS
procedures in their PMS plan. For example: trending, data analysis,
complaint handling etc. However, the manufacturer should provide a
summary of the relevant aspects of the procedure in the PMS plan and
ensure that any device specific requirements are adequately addressed.

Pitfall: The PMS plan does not provide an adequate justification as to
why PMCF is not applicable. Guidance: The purpose of PMCF is to
proactively collect new clinical data to address any gaps identified as
an output of the clinical evaluation and to identify if there are any
new/emergent risks that need to be considered. PMCF includes both
general and specific methods per Annex XIV Part B.6.2 (a & b). Specific
PMCF methods such as registry studies provide a means to collect new
clinical data to address unanswered questions and unknowns regarding
device safety and performance. Whereas general PMCF methods such as
feedback, literature screening, regulatory database searches provide a
simple yet effective proactive method for identifying new or emergent
risks even for devices with a long history of safe use. It is generally
accepted that if the clinical evaluation concludes that there are no
unknowns or gaps in the clinical evidence, a justification for not
performing specific PMCF methods may be appropriate, and this should be
provided in the PMS plan. Regarding general PMCF, per Annex III (1a),
manufacturers should collect and utilise information from various
sources such as specialist or technical literature, user feedback and
publicly information about similar devices. This is aligned with the
expectations of Annex XIV Part B, 6.1(a) on general PMCF methods and
procedures. To demonstrate compliance to these requirements and to
continually

evaluate the state of the art (SOTA), it is widely acknowledged that
general PMCF methods are expected for all devices including those that
make use of Article 61.10.

7.2 Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) Per MDR article 86, a PSUR must
be generated for Class IIa, IIb and III devices. The purpose of the PSUR
is to summarise the results and conclusions from the PMS data analysis
and any follow up preventive and corrective actions that were taken, and
to confirm continuing acceptability of the benefit: risk determination
for the duration of the lifetime of the device. For Class IIb and Class
III devices the PSUR must be updated at least annually. For Class IIa
devices, the PSUR should be updated when necessary or at least every 2
years. The PSUR for Class III and implantable devices must be submitted
to the notified body for evaluation. For Class IIa and IIb
non-implantable devices is typically reviewed by the notified body as
part of surveillance activities but must also be submitted to the
notified body if requested. The review period should be clearly stated
at the start of the PSUR. The timeframe during which the data discussed
within the PSUR was collected should be aligned with the review period
(time frame) covered by the PSUR. Any gaps should be justified, and
historical data clearly differentiated from new data. For guidance refer
to MDCG 2022-21.

Pitfall: Data and information are not analysed or presented in a
structured, consistent and readable format and it's not evident to the
notified body how the data and findings presented in the PSUR support
the manufacturers conclusion regarding acceptability of the benefit-risk
ratio. Guidance: MDCG 2022-21 has been developed to assist manufacturers
to clearly demonstrate compliance with the requirements of MDR Article
86. Whilst not mandatory, it is highly recommended that manufacturers
follow this guidance when generating the PSUR for their device: •

Annex I provides a structured template for the PSUR and guidance on how
to complete each section. The template is designed to ensure that the
PSUR is a stand-alone document that can be readily assessed
independently from other parts of the technical documentation.

•

Annex II provides guidance on how to present the data in the PSUR for
the purposes of demonstrating conformity to MDR Article 86.1(c) to MDR
Article 86.1 "description of any preventive and corrective actions".

•

Annex III Section 1.0 provides guidance on data presentation so that
relevance of the data to the device(s) covered by the scope of the
associated PMS plan can be readily determined. Guidance on how to assess
the data so that meaningful conclusions can be drawn is provided in
Annex III Section 2.0.

In addition to the guidance provided in MDCG 2022-21, manufacturers
should consider these additional points when assessing the data to draw
meaningful and verifiable conclusions regarding continued acceptability
of the benefit to risk: ▪ It should be clear from the PSUR which data is
historical and which data is new in the current reporting period. ▪ To
facilitate assessment on whether there has been any change to the
benefit-risk ratio, performance and safety objectives derived from SOTA
should be clearly stated in the PSUR and a clear comparison of the
devices' current performance versus SOTA provided. ▪ Comparative data
analysis should be used to clearly demonstrate whether there is a change
in the benefit: risk profile compared to previous years or if there any
emerging trends. This is especially important if the PSUR communicates
unfavourable data for the current reporting period. ▪ Data for different
devices under the same Basic UDI-DI should be stratified by
model/variants/size for ease of interpretation or a rationale provided.
It is important to note that the aim of the PSUR is not to duplicate all
the PMS data and reports but to summarize and discuss the results,
putting them into context in relation to SOTA, so that meaningful
conclusions can be drawn. Pitfall: Evidence that relevant data is fed
back into Risk Management and Clinical Evaluation and other parts of the
TD, whenever relevant, is not always clear. Guidance: Per MDR Article
61.11 and Article 83.3 (a-c), the manufacturer must consider the need to
review and update the clinical evaluation, risk management and other
elements of the technical documentation such as labelling and
Instructions for Use, based on the data discussed within the PSUR and
the resulting conclusions. It can be useful to provide a table towards
the end of the PSUR which demonstrates that the manufacturer has
considered the need to update other elements of the technical
documentation and when these updates will be made. Pitfall: Rationale
for not updating the SSCP (Class III and Implantable devices) based on
information and data presented in the PSUR is not present or unclear.
Guidance: Per MDR Article 61.11 and Article 83.3 (d), the SSCP must be
reviewed based on the outcome of the PSUR. The purpose of the
manufacturers review is to ensure that clinical and safety information
provided in the SSCP remains correct, complete and aligned with the
technical documentation. If the review concludes that the clinical and
safety information remains unchanged based on the PSUR and that no
update to the SSCP is needed, a justification should be documented.
Preferably the justification should be provided in the PSUR. If the
review determines that the SSCP requires updating with new clinical and
safety information, the manufacturer must consider the significance of
the change and whether it may require re-validation by the notified
body.

Changes that may require re-validation by the notified body: ▪
Administrative Changes to the Device Name, Manufacturer, BUDI & SRN. ▪
Changes to the intended purpose, indications, contraindications and
target populations. ▪ Changes to State of Art. ▪ Changes to the PMS /
PMCF Plans (specific activities). ▪ New or changed residual risks,
undesirable side effects, warnings and precautions. ▪ New variants or
new accessories, devices or products to be used in combination with the
device. ▪ Changes to any harmonised standards or CSs. ▪ Changes to the
intended user or training required to use the device safely. In some
cases, it may be possible to re-validate the SSCP based on the
information provided in the PSUR (e.g. administrative changes), whereas
other changes may require the notified body to conduct a review of
certain sections of the technical documentation.
