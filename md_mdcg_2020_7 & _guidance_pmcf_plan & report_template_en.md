> **Introduction**
>
> The Medical Device Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (MDR) considers the
> post-market clinical follow-up (PMCF) as a continuous process that
> updates the clinical evaluation and that shall be addressed in the
> manufacturer's post-market surveillance (PMS) plan. The MDR reinforces
> the PMCF process by the manufacturer, devoting part B of Annex XIV to
> it and providing a set of requirements for developing a plan,
> necessary to implement PMCF.
>
> A PMCF plan shall specify the methods and procedures set up by the
> manufacturer, to proactively collect and evaluate clinical data from
> the use in or on humans of a CE marked medical device, placed on the
> market or put into service within its intended purpose, as referred to
> in the relevant conformity assessment procedure.
>
> The aim of the PMCF plan is:
>
>  confirming the safety^1^ and performance, including the clinical
> benefit if applicable, of the device throughout its expected lifetime;
>
>  identifying previously unknown side-effects and monitor the
> identified side-effects and contraindications;
>
>  identifying and analysing emergent risks on the basis of factual
> evidence;
>
>  ensuring the continued acceptability of the benefit-risk ratio,
> referred to in Section 1 and 9 of Annex I in the MDR;
>
>  identifying possible systematic misuse or off-label use of the
> device, with a view to verifying that the intended purpose is correct.
>
> The PMCF plan shall be part of the post-market surveillance plan.
>
> The findings of the PMCF shall be analysed by the manufacturer who
> shall document the results in a PMCF evaluation report. The PMCF
> evaluation report shall be part of the clinical evaluation report and
> the technical documentation. The adequateness of the PMCF plan and its
> application is subject to assessment by the notified body. The
> notified body's assessment of the clinical evaluation shall also cover
> the manufacturer's procedures and documentation of the PMCF, as well
> as the justification in relation to non-performance of PMCF.
>
> The purpose of the present template is to guide manufacturers in
> complying with the requirements of the MDR with respect to the
> compilation of the PMCF plan. This would assist manufacturers in a
> harmonised and complete presentation of post market clinical data and
> facilitate the activity of notified bodies and competent authorities
> in finding the information in an organised format.
>
> 1 The confirmation of the safety includes the acceptability of
> identified risks and particularly residual risks.

> The Medical Device Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (MDR) considers the
> post-market clinical follow-up (PMCF) as a continuous process that
> updates the clinical evaluation and that shall be addressed in the
> manufacturer's post-market surveillance plan. The MDR reinforces the
> PMCF process by the manufacturer, devoting part B of Annex XIV to it
> and providing a set of requirements for developing a PMCF plan and its
> evaluation report, necessary to its implementation.
>
> The manufacturer shall analyse the findings coming from the activities
> foreseen in the PMCF plan and document the results in this PMCF
> evaluation report that shall be part of the clinical evaluation report
> and the technical documentation.
>
> The conclusions of the PMCF evaluation report shall be taken into
> account to update eventually the clinical evaluation, the risk
> management documentation, the post market surveillance plan and the
> SSCP, if applicable.
>
> The purpose of the present templates is to guide manufacturers in
> complying with the requirements of the MDR with respect to the
> compilation of the PMCF evaluation report. This would assist
> manufacturers in a harmonised and complete presentation of post market
> clinical data and facilitate the activity of notified bodies and
> competent authorities in finding the information in an organized
> format.
